## Project Overview

This project entails scraping product reviews from e-commerce platforms, preparing and labeling the dataset into four categories (positive, negative, competition sentiment, and future expectation), performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and training multiple machine learning models. It also involves the fine-tuning of a Llama 3 model for improved performance.

### Steps:
1. **Scraping Data**: Fetch reviews from Amazon and Flipkart.
2. **Data Preparation**: Label the data into four sentiment categories.
3. **EDA**: Analyze and visualize data distributions and patterns.
4. **Data Cleaning**: Remove stopwords, punctuation, and perform lemmatization.
5. **Feature Extraction**: Vectorize review content and encode sentiment labels.
6. **Model Training**: Train various ML models (SVC, RandomForest, XGBoost, Naive Bayes) with hyperparameter tuning.
7. **Ensemble Methods**: Implement stacking and voting classifiers.
8. **Deep Learning**: Fine-tune Llama 3 model for sequence classification. Evaluate various models like ANN, CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, and RoBERTa.
9. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using various metrics.
