Intel Core i3 12100F 12th Gen Generation Desktop PC Processor 4 CPU with 12MB Cache and up to 4.30 GHz Clock Speed LGA 1700 Socket,The best gaming CPU in its price range.,"ðŸ“‹ â­Product Descriptionâ­: the IntelÂ® i3 12100F is a 12th generation processor, equipped with 4 latest generation high-performance cores and 8 threads, mounts on motherboards with LGA1700 connection, supports DDR4 and DDR5 RAM, supports PCI-E 5.0 and 4.0 connections, has a system clock from a minimum of 3.3GHz and up to 4.3GHz, has a minimum consumption of 60W and 89W peak, overclocking is not foreseen to further raise the operating frequency ,but it supports RAM overclocking in both DDR4 and DDR5, this function allows it to gain performance (especially in gaming) almost comparable to the overclocking of the processor if it were unlocked. This is in short the synopsis of this processor, the web is full of much more technical reviews that explain why the Intel i3 1200F is currently the best and only gaming CPU in the 110/130 euro range. The performance is unequivocally excellent for those who want to play in full-HD while maintaining a low budget. Furthermore, in many video games it plays on par with processors that cost almost twice as much and have a few more cores. It also defends itself very well in single core benchmarks, however in loads with many cores it obviously loses something. The double compatibility with both DDR4 and DDR5 and with PCI-E 4.0 and 5.0 allows us to also be able to choose a motherboard with a price suited to our budget, such as an H610 compatible with the i3 12000F but which only supports DDR4 and PCI-E 4.0. So an economical motherboard that features DDR4 RAM that is easily available at more humane prices than DDR5 just to clarify, furthermore the i3 12000F is also high-performance and competitive with DDR4 and various tests on the web demonstrate this. ðŸ“¦ â­Packagingâ­: The box is in the classic Intel colour, with seal to be removed, as proof of a new product, inside we find the processor in its plastic tray, an excellent Intel heatsink, suitable for the CPU in question with already the dissipating patch applied to its base, a concise manual with the detachable IntelÂ® Core i3 sticker attached on the main page to be affixed, if desired, to the front of the case. ðŸšš â­Shippingâ­: By Amazon, therefore fast, safe and compliant with company standards. ðŸ“‰ðŸ“ˆ â­Final considerationsâ­: An excellent processor with excellent performance if you want to keep spending within a certain range but which defends itself very well both in gaming and in everyday work. my personal rating related to the Performance/price ratio is â­â­â­â­â­ stars. My rating scale is defined as follows: â­ï¸ star product to avoid â­ï¸â­ï¸ stars insufficient product, â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸ stars sufficient product, â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸ stars good product, â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸ stars product excellent.

Intel Core i3 12100F 12th Gen Generation Desktop PC Processor 4 CPU with 12MB Cache and up to 4.30 GHz Clock Speed LGA 1700 Socket,Ideal for gaming and multimedia.,"This 12th generation of Intel processors is definitely excellent! For 20 years, I had only bought AMD, but after reading numerous tests which had highlighted the qualities of the 12100F, I decided to take the plunge. Initially, I wanted a processor that was both powerful enough for games, and which did not heat up (and therefore did not consume power). Firstly because it was intended to be placed in an HTPC, having in essence a somewhat complicated airflow, and then because I wanted to optimize the performance/energy ratio. I think it's mission accomplished. When playing movies, or while listening to music, the Intel processor and the graphics card (GTX 1660 TI) do not each exceed 35Â°C, and rise respectively to 47Â°C and 62Â°C during gaming sessions. . I would like to point out that the 12100F is cooled by a Low Profile Noctua NHL-12S cooler, supported by an Arctic P12 fan, and is attached to the socket by an adjustment frame, supposed to prevent deformation of the processor surface, from Thermalright. In terms of power, this processor can be associated with any graphics card without limiting the potential of the latter, except perhaps those above the very powerful AMD RX 6900 XT and the RTX 3080 TI. In applications, however, the Intel will be a little fishy without being ridiculous. Know that it has as many responses as a top of the range 4 years ago. To summarize, considering the price, the 12100F is the best for a computer intended for versatile and economical use.",06-Oct-22,5,Franck de BZH,France,positive

Cons: It has a very poor cooling system (CPU fan-cooler) that I do not recommend, it sounds quite loud and under load it does not keep the processor at a temperature less than 69 degrees Celsius (and it is not worth the paper), I solved it with a cooler master hyper h411R cooler that fits perfectly in LGA 1700.",12-Apr-22,4,Levit S.,Spain,positive

Intel Core i3 12100F 12th Gen Generation Desktop PC Processor 4 CPU with 12MB Cache and up to 4.30 GHz Clock Speed LGA 1700 Socket,Excellent entrylevel CPU,"A truly excellent CPU. If obviously you are looking for an entrylevel product. From the reviews it has higher-end performance from a few years ago, the CPU has 4 cores with HT so it manages 8Th. I purchased it for a second PC in a micro-ATX case with a single 92mm rear extension. In terms of performance and responsiveness, the CPU is really not bad for navigation and playback. I did some benching like CPUZ and it goes a little better than my R5 1600 in multi (6c/12t) and much more in ST. In essence, if you are looking for a CPU for navigation, playback, light productivity, gaming (perhaps retrogaming on DX11 games) it is the right product. If you play modern games (DX12) and with a sustained refresh goal (even minimal) then a 12400 or higher is better (talking about Intel). I did some tests with Intelburntest and the CPU remains at 4.089GHz on all cores with T of 75Â° in winter and 82Â° in July. Let me start by saying that I use the stock I only changed the thermal paste (Arctic MX4).  The fan tends to spin a little fast to keep the T under control, however it is not very noisy. Let's say that in my opinion the dissi is a bit at the limit but it keeps the CPU at bay.

As an entry-level chip in the current Alder Lake architecture, it not only offers sufficient computing power for demanding server tasks, but also impresses with a very efficient energy balance. The modern hybrid design of four performance and four efficiency cores enables balanced operation at all times. Demanding tasks such as video transcoding, multitasking or containerization are handled by the fast P-cores with a high clock rate. The energy-saving E-cores take over the job for less complex background processes. With boost clock rates of up to 4.3 GHz out of the box, the i3-12100 offers enormous performance reserves for compute-intensive NAS workloads such as video streaming, multimedia services or data backup tasks, even without overclocking. The modern Skylake architecture and 12MB intelligent cache further accelerate data throughput. The low power consumption allows the use of cooler and quieter power supplies and cooling systems. This significantly reduces the operating costs and noise levels of the NAS. The Core i3-12100 proves to be an extremely versatile performance provider for demanding home users and semi-professional NAS systems.

Assuming your average cooler is about 10 dollars, you really can't go wrong with an 84 dollar cpu capable of 500+ fps on minecraft, 300+ fps on valorant, etc. I will say though, a quad core cpu in 2023 is a bit questionable, since you'll have extra issues streaming and recording games. The cache is also pretty low for this cpu, but you really can't hate too much on a 90 dollar cpu at this magnitude of performance. Overall solid cpu, more than I need for games and editing.

Buy this and call it a day. If you need something to handle Microsoft Office, any browser (your internet connection matters more), and basic applications, the 12100 is all you need. Loading time is very good. You really don't need amazing graphics to perform any of these tasks. I'm using integrated video and it suits me just fine. My other computer uses the APU on an AMD 5600G and I've never had issues. I paired this CPU with a barebones Gigabyte motherboard (cheapest I could find) and 8GB of DDR4 memory and it rivals my AMD setup for plain tasks. Don't feel like you need an i5, i7, or even the i3 12400 if you just need an everyday computer for watching videos, doing online banking, or crunching out work material (unless you are editing heavy media). This i3-12100 is the equivalent of a quad core processor from years back. If you are working on virtual machines, doing strong programming, have a million windows open, need to use Adobe Creative Suite to quickly produce and export content, then you may want to consider moving up to a stronger processor. Even so, this one is still pretty good - it will just take longer to complete some things. I'm overall very happy with this processor and I think most households who have similar requirements will be satisfied. The 12400 did get to $160 at some point so that could be something to look at to future proof a machine since it has six cores (not that I need them right now).",19-May-22,5,Average Customer,the United States,positive

I was a little misinformed about the built in graphics and thought when I bought it was I was getting Iris Xe, but it's something called UHD. The product description clearly says UHD, so my bad really. Most of the other Intel 12th gen chips with graphics processing have Iris Xe which has many more graphics processing units. For sure the UHD is fine for many things including streaming video. Not sure about 3D gaming, though. Had I know it was UHD and not Iris, I might have saved $30 or so and bought the version without the graphics. On the other hand, I liked the idea of onboard graphics as a backup or alternative. In either case, this i3 runs like a champ compared to the quad core phenom ii based system it's replacing. I'm not sure it's relevant here but I think I should mention that my Asrock board can't make use of the on board UHD graphics when you set BIOS to legacy mode. You need to use the UEFI mode in order to use the on board graphics. Not sure if that's typical of other boards or board brands. With my Asrock board, you need a discrete graphics card to use the legacy bios mode to boot from an old non-UEFI installation of windows.

And also the clips are so fragile that you might break one someday trying to fit it just provide us with a simple screw and bolt cooler with a proper mounting. Also the performance is not nice, many would say stock cooler is more than enough for 12400f but in my case when rendering a video my cpu temps touched 100 degrees so I took out the cooler and reinstalled it to ensure proper installation but still it was going 90 to 95+Degrees. And it was approx the same case while gaming. Idk maybe my cooler clips are just faulty that the cooler is not able to mount properly and is not doing any cooling.

In most cases these were overkill and ran hot with high wattages! Most of the work I was doing offloaded everything to my GPU so having a beastly CPU was a waste. I've downgraded to this CPU in my main desktop rig. It's great for productivity software (music and design work) as well as gaming. I have it paired with a RTX 4000 series card and haven't noticed a significant drop in frame rates whilst gaming. (maybe 1-5 FPS) In most games I max out the monitor's 144Hz/FPS at 1440p. One different thing about this CPU over other Intel offerings is that it has 6 performance cores (with 12 threads - hyperthreading) and no low powered efficiency cores. (they are only really needed for laptops anyway to save battery power!) The CPU is also very efficient and runs quite cool. Mine is 26c when idle and 26-30 light tasks such as browsing the web. During gaming - the temps are usually in the mid 50s. Benchmarking (such as Cinebench and Geekbench etc) reaches mid 60s.

It also has an 18MB L3 cache and a 7.5MB L2 cache. The Core i5-12400F delivers remarkable performance in applications and games. It shows itself capable of competing with more high-end processors, such as AMD's Ryzen 5 5600X or Intel's Core i7-11700K. It is particularly efficient in tasks that exploit multithreading, such as video encoding, compression or rendering. It also ensures optimal fluidity in the most recent games, even at high resolution. The Core i5-12400F also stands out for its energy efficiency. It has a base power consumption of 65 watts and a maximum consumption of 117 watts[^1^][1]. It is therefore easy to cool and does not require an overly expensive or noisy cooling system. It also helps reduce electricity bills and environmental impact. The Core i5-12400F is therefore an excellent choice for those looking for a powerful, versatile and energy-efficient processor. It offers unbeatable value for money to take full advantage of the benefits of Intel's 12th generation. However, it requires a motherboard compatible with the LGA1700 socket and a dedicated graphics card.",12-Oct-23,5,Tommy,France,positive
"Intel Core I5 12400F 12 Gen Generation Desktop Pc Processor 6, Cpu with 18Mb Cache and Up to 4.40 Ghz Clock Speed Ddr5 and Ddr4 Ram Support Lga 1700 Socket, Micro Atx",It is most likely still the best mid-range gaming PC processor in 2023.,"INTRO As it should be, instead of buying laptops and pre-assembled ones, a true nerd builds his own computer, and beyond this, he shares his experience in the ancient art of PC Building with friends and relatives. My brother needed to use a computer, and imagining the sadness of seeing him with a laptop, a pre-assembled one or even worse with a Mac, I thought of building him a custom-made computer. And anyway, what better way to convert someone to PC Gaming than with a computer assembled with a lot of brotherly love? I therefore decided to choose this processor because since it is a build essentially for school use + gaming, and with a relatively limited budget (ok brotherly love and all but let's not exaggerate), it seemed like the best compromise between performance and quality. In the end the seller sent me the 12400F, but I wanted the 12400, so I returned it, and bought the 12500 which is identical apart from the integrated GPU and slightly higher frequencies, so I can review it anyway given which are essentially the same processor. It is a 6 core and 12 thread processor, which does not have the elusive E-cores of the more expensive series (for example, the 12600 has 6P-Cores like this one plus 4E-Cores which help in background operations, especially if used Windows 11), at a frequency of 2.5 Ghz with a boost up to 4.4Ghz if temperatures, workload, and your motherboard allow it. A processor of this type excels in gaming, but it doesn't suck even in the most complicated operations, in fact this processor also performs very well in video editing with Adobe Premiere. I paired it with a Gigabyte RTX3060 12G and 32Gb of DDR4 at 3200Mhz, all on an Asus B660M-A Prime. PERFORMANCE AND TEMPERATURES As I said before, it is a mid-range processor particularly suitable for gaming, but which manages even the most ""professional"" operations without any problems. The architecture of these 12th generation Intel processors, after a rather disappointing 11th generation, is excellent. Without giving numbers with benchmarks and other difficult things, I can tell you that in gaming it performs at the same level as the good old Ryzen 5 5600X, undoubtedly the best mid-range processor together with this one. I don't think you will have any problems with gaming or productivity using this processor, assuming the rest of the hardware is up to par. I use it with banal DDR4 at 3200Mhz, so in terms of performance we are similar to the 5600X that I had on one of my builds from last year, but if you combine it with some serious DDR5 it can certainly surpass it even if only slightly. In any case, it performs very well in gaming, especially when combined with a somewhat serious GPU (like my RTX3060). I didn't notice any bottlenecks, especially in the case of this build, which will be used with a ""only"" 1080p monitor. As far as temperatures go, it is a fairly quiet CPU with a TDP of only 65W. I don't have a heatsink at the moment, because I didn't receive it, so I'm using the stock heatsink included in the package. I expected it to be pitiful, but it's definitely acceptable. The temperatures do not exceed 70C in gaming, even with heavy games, while making the most of it with a Cinebench, it does not exceed 80C, which is acceptable and well below the throttling threshold of 100C. Even the noise of the original fan is quite low, so well, maybe I'll keep it with the stock heatsink. However, my case, an NZXT with 4 additional fans, certainly helps a lot, in addition to this I didn't trust the layer of pre-applied thermal paste, and I put my trusty Gelid GC Extreme in it, because for a 65W processor with the I said stock you definitely need Extreme level thermal paste. F OR NOT F VERSION? TRAY OR BOX? INTEGRATED GPU? The difference between the two versions lies in the availability of the integrated GPU. The F version doesn't include it, and generally costs a little less. Depending on the price difference, consider whether to take one or the other. I'm not a fan of Intel integrated GPUs and I always try to combine a dedicated GPU whenever possible, even if it's very scarce. In this case I have the RTX3060 which is a good gaming card, so why did I want to get the processor with the integrated GPU? Because with certain programs that support Intel Quicksync technology, the integrated GPU does not sit there sleeping but is actively used for video encoding or other operations, such as the timeline in Premiere. The little brother uses Adobe Premiere which can take advantage of this technology, but other video editing or streaming programs also use it, such as OBS Studio, which can exploit the video encoder of the integrated GPU to trim, leaving the dedicated GPU free for gaming . In any case, the Integrated GPU is the usual one",06-Mar-23,5,MRK,Italy,positive

Balanced Gaming: Gaming performance is solid, ensuring stable frame rates in recent games. Effective thread management contributes to a better gaming experience. Smooth productivity: For everyday productivity tasks such as web browsing, document processing and multitasking, the processor offers a fast and smooth experience. Power consumption: Thanks to Alder Lake architecture and advanced manufacturing processes, power consumption is low, contributing to greater efficiency. Detailed flaws of the Intel i5 12400F: Lack of integrated graphics: The lack of an integrated graphics unit means the need to purchase a discrete graphics card, which increases the overall cost, especially if the user does not already own one. Overclocking Limitations: For those interested in overclocking, the processor may not offer the same capabilities as the ""K"" variants of the same family.

So I swapped my 12100f and it was worth it. In games you can't notice it with older ones, but newer titles get more FPS and above all the game runs a bit smoother, the minimum FPS is higher. In office applications it doesn't matter whether it has 4/8 or 6/12 cores, you can't notice it, but when I convert an MKV file to AVI it saves about 40% time. With the Arcitc Freezer ESport Duo it doesn't run over 35C in office mode, over 60C in games and over 75C when converting files (100% load), what more could I want, and since I'm sure I can still get rid of my old 12100f, the new one is even cheaper :-)",30-Apr-24,5,Persilmann,Germany,positive

For the price there is nothing to complain about when it comes to gaming. I think the CPU is aimed at that kind of gamer because of the lack of an iGPU. First of all there are only 2 negative points which are not that important for me personally. 1 no iGPU without its own graphics card no image 2 boxed cooler can be thrown out immediately (despite the stated 65 watts) with boxed cooler over 80 degrees Then on to the positive points - performance for just â‚¬119 you get a CPU with which you can play pretty much any game above 60 FPS. -Temperatures even if the boxed cooler is no use the CPU can be kept at 50 to 52 degrees under full load with a normal air cooler (â‚¬20) which is absolutely great. There is simply nothing to complain about for this price and every 1080p gamer up to 144Hertz should be happy with the CPU.

The only flaw, it may be the new architecture, it may be the bios of the motherboards, but the turbo core does not go to 4.4Ghz on all cores at the same time (as was the case on the previous 6xxx 7xxx series or on X99 or X299 platforms the famous ""enhanced turbo boost"" option "" is not implemented here) but it stops at 4 gigahertz. However, I don't think it can change that much in gaming, having seen several comparative videos even with i7 and i9 of the same series and the fps are practically the same.. which leaves several questions on the sense or otherwise of spending 3 times as much to get little or nothing more, still remaining in the gaming field, in productivity processors with more threads will certainly make the difference.",26-Mar-24,5,Alessandro,Italy,positive

It doesn't get all that loud and it looks halfway decent.  It seems to keep the temps down to the mid 80s under stress testing (70 ambient) and mid 60s during actual gaming.  I will replace it eventually but I'm not that concerned as it works fine.  I did wipe off the pre-pasted thermal grease and added some MX-4 instead. The internal HD 730 is nice to have as a backup.  Anyone who doesn't need that should seek out the ""12400F"" model as it's the exact same chip with no internal GPU, and it should be $15-$25 cheaper.

All very nice except that at least in this example there was no way to make the first PCIE 16X lane work and therefore the result was completely useless, certainly for gaming. I tried on three different motherboards, b760 and z690, in all cases and bios settings it was not possible to use the first slot. While the other slots were used correctly and, for example, in the second PCIE slot the video card was recognized, but it only worked at gen3 X8. However, you will understand that using a video card worth perhaps â‚¬600 at a quarter of its potential is unacceptable. Amazon excellent as always in making the return.

Intel Core i5-12600K Desktop Processor 10 (6P+4E) Cores up to 4.9 GHz Unlocked Socket LGA 1700 600 Series Chipset 125W,All's well that ends well.,"I was surprised when it said it had been delivered (has it been handed over?... or not) even though it hadn't arrived, but it was later changed to ""delivered"" and was delivered safely, though it was delayed considerably. Not only this, but the D15S 17XX compatible mounting kit was also temporarily missing, and it took almost a month to get all the parts, so I seriously considered changing the configuration. It was a difficult birth, but the completed PC was stable from the start compared to the ASUS Z790-PD4CSM + i5-13600K configuration, which was a nightmare of blue and black screens and repeated freezes, and the blue screen only occurred when running OC + Cinebench R23 (â—Ž). The PC configuration is MB ASROCK Z690 PRO RS + CPU (this one) + memory CFD DDR4 3200 16G x 2 + CPU cooler D15S plus 12cm fan (reused), and the rest is omitted. The figures for Cinebench R23 unlimited power (maximum 5GHz), long-term 65W*short-term 120W*peak temperature 62â„ƒ are ASUS Z790+i5-13600K configuration 23000*18000, this is about 18000*13000, which is about 78*72% of the performance. There is nothing to see in terms of performance, but it is much quieter when unlimited power, which seems to be largely due to the difference in the MB manufacturer's thinking, PC case, and CPU cooler used. The performance is sufficient for use in the dining room, so I have no complaints, but it's a bit painful that I had to buy the 11Pro. (package version) because the certification did not pass. Currently, the 13600K is about 47,000 yen, 78% of this is 36,600 yen, and 72% is about 33,840 yen, so the CP value is even. It was 31,028 yen when I bought it, and even if I spent a few hundred yen on the phone to confirm the location, it was a good value at the time, but at the current selling price, I would not regret choosing the 13600K even if it was a stretch, and I think I would have chosen a different CPU. The Ï†120 fan (93.97CFM) in the image was placed in the back rather than the front, which lowered the CPU temperature, resulting in the placement in the image. 2023/01/03 Addition I couldn't read the image numbers on the 4k screen, so I replaced it with an FHD one.",02-Jan-24,5,æ‚ªå…Žã®æ—¦é‚£,Japan,negative

I don't see any of the downs being the fault of the chip or Intel. Most of the issues I have experienced with the new system (and there have been many), have to do with the motherboard or ddr5. I upgraded from a i7 4770k I had on a 24/7 4.8ghz overclock for 7 years. The new I5 is CLEARLY faster in both single and multi threaded performance. Like many I experience many errors in the windows 11 event viewer usually something to do with an efficiency core. At the end of the day I don't see any real world effects on performance, and even microsoft says to ignore these errors. I have traditionally chosen intel because of their on board graphics support. I've had a graphics card go out in the past and having on board video allows you to at least use your system as a system while you figure out what has happened. If amd ever decides to see the value in having on board video from an administrator perspective; I may have to reconsider them. I am happy with the upgrade to the new chip and support for the new technology will only get better.

I was nervous at first, because my plan was to build a low-ish power, 100% passively-cooled, internal GPU, no moving parts PC for use in my bedroom, where my previous computers were annoyingly loud. I used a Noctua NH-P1 passive cooler and a Seasonic PX-500 fanless PSU, and my system is not only 100% silent, it turns in impressive benchmark numbers and never gets close to throttling temperatures even after sustained Cinebench runs. I run my system at -130 mV, with no overclocking, and CPU power consumption peaks at about 100 W, while idle CPU power consumption is less than 2W. My heatsink never gets too hot to touch with my bare hand in daily use. The only thing preventing my system from being a high performance gaming PC is the lack of dedicated GPU, but the internal GPU is more than enough for me to run four simultaneous instances of BlueStacks 5 to play my favorite mobile game, and fast enough to run Diablo III and EVE Online with medium settings.

Although there is a continuing tug of war between Intel and AMD in this regard. I personally chose Intel Core i7 (12700K) with inbuilt UHD graphics for my newly built desktop PC. For those, who don't want to use a separate and usually exorbitantly priced graphics cards, this processor is a very good alternative. It can handle most of the processing intensive rendering of Blender easily with its unlocked overclocking (obviously you have to use the supporting motherboard, i.e. presently available Z690 chipset motherboards). It can also smoothly handle almost all the tasks of Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop with no hiccups. Not to mention the support of 4K video with HDR if you are looking for some decent and the latest entertainment in your PC. I would suggest this 12th Gen i7 to those who want to use their PC for content creation purpose in the best possible way and also at the same time save some money (compared to 12th Gen i9, which would ideally be the best anyway, but costlier too).

Intel Core i7-12700K Desktop Processor 12 (8P+4E) Cores up to 5.0 GHz Unlocked LGA 1700 600 Series Chipset 125W,The best CPU I've owned so far. Rivaling even the 5900X! Intel is killing the game as of now.,"I upgraded to this CPU after some HEAVY research, asking Reddit (Both Intel and AMD subreddits), weighing in money VS performance gained. I have used AMD since I was a teen and started building computers. The conclusion is this: It is an amazing CPU, runs faster and cooler than my Ryzen 7 1700. The price AND performance VS AMD (Also including a board) was better than if I had went with a Ryzen 7 5800X. Some background information: I wanted to upgrade after receiving an Amazon gift card (I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon though). I upgraded from a Ryzen 7 1700, with an ASUS x370-f board. I really wanted to upgrade, and was sad also that Windows 11 did not support my CPU! I will give it to Microsoft for this, as it made A LOT of people upgrade their entire computers, all for basically the same OS as of now with newer looks, and not much done under the hood (EXCEPT for 12th gen Intel, so good news there too). Sadly, my old board STILL doesn't support the Ryzen 7 5000 series, and only the 3000 series (They are working on a BIOS apparently for the 5000 series, because of people who were in my shoes). I first almost ordered the Ryzen 7 3800XT, for $400! After a couple hours of research, asking, and thinking about it... I cancelled that order (Thankfully) and thought ""Well, if I am going to spend this much on upgrading my CPU, I might as well go all in/spend a little more for something better, as this may be my last big upgrade in this regard for awhile."" I was then going to get the Ryzen 7 5800X with an Asus board. There lied a problem of price, I could not find a board AND get that CPU still within my budget (At-least not a board that wasn't worse than the one I had in ways). I mentioned I had posted on the AMD subreddit, and even they suggested I go Intel (Intel is just killing it as of now, hands down, although I am sure AMD will retaliate). I ended up getting the MSI Z690-A DDR4 (I wish I had the money for DDR5 RAM, I would have went with the DDR5 version as it was basically the same price). I had A LOT of second thoughts on this board though, as it just didn't seem ""Premium"" as the one I had (I am going to do a whole review on it after this. I'll save my Pros & Cons for there.) This CPU also auto-clocks itself up or down depending on the load (Saw it clock down to 1GHz, although not for long, for example if not much processing power is warranted, which makes sense and I wish everything did). So if idling, it will clock down and save power/heat/and therefore longevity is increased. I absolutely love this CPU coming from AMD. Anyways... If you have a Corsair H100I RGB Platinum or similar cooler already: The included 1200 screws work just fine with the 1700 socket and this CPU, even though you are supposed to get the 1700 kit/screws for this CPU (Which I did, but they are taking FOREVER to ship, so I googled, and someone said using the 1200 screws will work just fine). I get better temps. than my Ryzen 7 1700. I can even overclock EVEN MORE but have no need, and no point. TL:DR Upgraded from: Ryzen 7 1700, Asus Rog Strix x370-f gaming. Upgraded to: i7-12700K, MSI Z690-A DDR4. Parts kept: 4x8GB 32GB DDR4 CL16 3000MHz RAM (With XMP, D.O.C.P), RTX 2070. The RAM works great with this CPU as well, although it TECHNICALLY (Latency wise, runs at 2T on Intel instead of 1T on AMD) runs slower than when on AMD (AMD's infinity fabric) but obviously whatever Intel is doing makes up for that, and therefore my RAM either runs faster/the same) Pros: It is an amazing CPU for price VS performance. The i5-12600K is good as well (I almost just went with it), and you would be fine going with it for gaming (As even it still has more cores technically than the Ryzen 7 5800X, it also beats the 5800X even though THIS CPU is supposed to be its comparison rival brother.) This CPU has cool temps on my Corsair H100I RGB Platinum cooler, and the P&E core structure are REALLY cool and fun to watch when doing tasks/gaming. It shipped fast! Cons: Literally none with the CPU itself. Just with shipping - It shipped really fast! Was here in 2-3 days after purchasing on here. The biggest complaint I have is Amazon's shipping (SO BE AWARE OF THIS) I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon, and have always used New-egg. They just left the CPU in my mail-box, and if it weren't for me looking at my camera's, and looking out for this part, it would have sat in the mail-box all day. My mail-box sadly is not very weather proof as well, and if it had been raining... It wouldn't have been good. Although it did come in a big box around it. The CPU also was jarred loose and flopping around in the box (Not held into the front window). I hope this review helps people!",25-Feb-22,5,Jacob,the United States,positive

Before buying I was a bit skeptical since I'm not a fan of Intel's newer way of handling cores, but the first thing I tried when I got it was emulating PS3 games and right off the bat I saw compile times cut tenfold and stability at least doubled. The older CPUs from the 8th, 9th, and 10th gen are perfectly usable for most people so if you're on a budget maybe look on the used market for those.

The only real downside of the 13600k is that it generally requires a 13th gen compatible motherboard, otherwise you'll need to FLASH THE BIOS on a 12th gen compatible motherboard to update the motherboard for it to be able to read 13th gen CPU (I highly do not recommend doing this). I've tried it a few and it's such a big hassle (many potential issues...)that I recommend first time PC builders or part buyers to just save yourself a headache and buy a 13th gen CPU, along with a 13th gen compatible motherboard (don't buy 12th gen mobo) which obviously doesn't require flashing bios for the 13600k to be usable.",05-Aug-23,4,Sai,Canada,competition sentiment

Intel Core i7-12700K Desktop Processor 12 (8P+4E) Cores up to 5.0 GHz Unlocked LGA 1700 600 Series Chipset 125W,Watch the price on this one,"The i7-12700K is in the top 5 for gaming CPUs right now. AMD is doing fairly well as of late but Intel has a solid performance lead with it's single core performance on newer generation chips. If you're on the fence and want a quick top 5 for overall gaming performance, it goes as follows: 1. i9-13900k 2. i7-13700k 3. i9-12900k 4. i5-13600k 5. i7-12700k This chip is no slouch though, it trades blows with the 13600K in some situations if overclocked but overclocking isn't really fair for comparison. In conclusion, if you're looking around this price point, check both this CPU and the 13600k. Pick whichever is cheaper. Higher end 12th gen Intel motherboards can be flashed in the BiOS to take 13th gen CPUs too, but do your research on those before going that route.

Upgrading to this has been more than significant. As of this writing, I hope you've done your research the I7-12700k's price point and its competition. For this price point, it may be the top dog. Some things to consider before purchasing: 1) Make sure you are purchasing a LGA 1700 motherboard. I went with the DDR4 motherboard because DDR5 is still at its infancy. The DDR5 ram may not be the best option for your buck right now. You'll be fine with DDR4. 2) This CPU does consume a lot more power compared to its predecessor. Double check if your PSU will be enough. There are online resources that will help you calculate your PSU. It's always good to have a little overhead. 3) Make sure your heatsink has retrofit screws that's compatible with this motherboard. You can purchase them separately. If you have a heatsink that's very old (<2016), it's more than likely it may not be compatible. Good luck!",15-Feb-22,5,Stephen,the United States,positive

So far it's impressive.  It runs much cooler than my i9-9900k (mild OC) ( 59C-63C under a gaming load vs 75C+) but that could've been due to the my old AIO being in it's death throws for the past few months.  3DMark CPU score went up noticeably as well.  Overall, I'm pretty happy with it.  Haven't messed around with overclocking yet, but there doesn't seem to be as much headroom left as there used to be,  from what I've read 5.3 Ghz is about what you can expect.

Idle temps stay in the 30s. That's with the cpu wattage unlocked and raising the pl1 and pl2 settings a bit in the bios and a single intake and single exhaust fan in a mid size case. I learned a long time ago that ambient room temp and fan curves are very important. You want to exhaust as much hot air as you can out of the case as fast as possible. You can mount a skyscraper to your CPU and have 12 case fans, if your room temp is high and you don't set proper fan curves, you'll still run hot. I don't care about cinebench or other benchmarks, most games people play and apps people use on a daily basis will never stress the CPU anywhere near what a benchmark will. If you do a lot of heavy video editing and conversion work and raise your wattage limits way up then yes go for a higher end cooling solution . Edit: I've since installed an Intel RH1 cooler (the one that comes with the i9) on this chip and it dropped my temps by an average of about 8c. I know I can buy a third party cooler but I don't want a huge cpu cooler in my case and I don't want to play with brackets that may not fit 100% correctly.

Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor16 (8P+8E) Cores up to 5.2 GHz Unlocked LGA1700 600 Series Chipset 125W,Simple water cooling (240mm) is OK for rated use,"Purchased in May 2022. Operated with ASUS simple water cooling (ROG240mm). The case is old so I gave up on 360mm. At rated use, the CPU temperature can be maintained in the late 80s when encoding H.265. Since it is a Z690 motherboard, it is overclocked. Up to 6 cores can be rotated at a multiplier of 54. The temperature will reach about 90Â°C. The voltage is offset by -0.05V. In this case, the power consumption did not reach 241W according to the core temp reading. However, just by tweaking the all-core and setting the multiplier to 50, it consumes nearly 300W and the CPU temperature instantly reaches 100Â°C. Thermal throttling is activated immediately. In both cases, the room temperature was 27Â°C. Even if you use a simple 360mm water cooling system, I don't think you can suppress the temperature from rising to 100Â°C in an instant, so if you don't want to hit thermal throttling, overclocking is difficult? I thought. If it's a single core, it works stably at 54x, so I'm satisfied. I replaced my 6700K with this, but when I encoded a 10-minute video in H.265, it took about 15 minutes on the 6700K and about 7 minutes on the 12900K. I can feel the change in the times. Even when editing a video in premiere Pro (4K 8 streams), all cores did not reach full power. I guess it only happens when encoding and running the bench. It does heat up, but for everyday use it can be operated with a 240mm simple water cooling system.",04-Jun-22,5,Amazonã®ã¨ã‚Šã“,Japan,positive
Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor16 (8P+8E) Cores up to 5.2 GHz Unlocked LGA1700 600 Series Chipset 125W,Not necessary for everyone,"This isn't the processor for everyone, but it is very fast. The individual cores aren't significantly different from those in the 13th generation i7. But if you have a need for a lot of parallel processing then this may be the processor for you. I do software development, which it doesn't help 99% of the time, gaming, which it helps a little, and occasionally transcoding large amounts of video and music. During transcoding it helps a huge amount. I have over 300GB of FLAC audio files that I ripped from my CD collection, I never buy mp3s. I wanted to have that on my phone, but I didn't want to carry it at full rate because I can't tell the difference in the car, so I transcoded it. I had done that once before and it took more than a day on a five year old Ryzen 7. This machine took around 30 minutes. 30-40 times faster. At work the optics team, which uses ray tracing software to design optical telescopes and laser focusing lenses, uses i9s in preference to Xeons. The Xeons might be faster under some circumstances, but the machines are hugely expensive, so the i9s are much better for price performance. Would I buy it again? I'd probably buy the 13th generation, but if I had any sense I'd just get the 13th gen i7.",11-May-23,5,Chris H,the United States,positive

Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor16 (8P+8E) Cores up to 5.2 GHz Unlocked LGA1700 600 Series Chipset 125W,Amazing CPU,"Purchased this CPU to finally upgrade my tired 8086k that I have had for close to 4 years now, and considering I also own a 3090 I was lucky enough to get last year, it was time. Paired with said gpu and a MSI Tomahawk Z690 with a Noctua NH-D15 Chromax Black cooler, this cpu runs complete marathons around my old 8086k. Certain games that would fully saturate my 8086k while also getting notifications from something like Discord would introduce very bad stutter, however those are completely eliminated with the 12900k. Temps are high when Im doing full resolution photo renders from my DJI Air 2S or Sony a6400 or straight up benchmarking, but that is expected and I'm not one to sweat about 80-90c temps, but if you are I would recommend the 12700k/5900x as they both run cooler and draw less wattage. However in gaming with multiple different Firefox tabs and discord/telegram open, it never even touches 70c, so your experience may vary depending on what type of work load you are doing. Make sure that if you do have a high powered gpu that you also have a high output power supply with a high efficiency rating as well, as my system can suck north of 600-750w full tilt (my power supply being a 1200w platinum EVGA that doesnt break a sweat under full load).",21-Feb-22,5,Kira,the United States,positive

I upgraded from the 9900K and this has been a noticeable difference. I'm still in the process of updating drivers and reinstalling some software. I haven't done any overclocking so the Cinebench score and temps are straight stock settings. After seeing all the info on how hot this thing can get I added the Thermalright contact frame. It was a breeze to install. I watched the Gamer's Nexus video about this frame and followed their directions. For the motherboard I went with a MSI Z690 MPG Edge Wifi DDR4 so I could reuse my current RAM. I had to order a LGA 1700 bracket for the NZXT Kraken X73 AIO. I ordered both the frame and the LGA 1700 mount from Amazon and both arrived fast and were exactly what I needed. So far my temps are staying in the general range of my 9900K. I'm planning to do a little gaming this week with it so I'll have a chance to see how it does under my daily use. I also do a bit of Premiere and After Effects so I'm looking forward to seeing how it works there as well. Overall, this is probably way more processor than I NEED. I was still able to do what I needed to do with the 9900K. I built the 9900K in 2020 during the height of the astronomically high PC price wave. I ended up getting this processor for about $100 less than I paid for the 9900K two years ago. So the price-to-performance upgrade for me was a no brainer.

Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor16 (8P+8E) Cores up to 5.2 GHz Unlocked LGA1700 600 Series Chipset 125W,Insanely fast computation!,I only used laptops up to this point and this is my first PC build however I got this processor specifically for Workstation class computation and high performance gaming. The Core i9-12900K is blazing fast and uses very little watts for gaming mostly hovering around 65W~80W in the games I have played so far. It renders 3D projects at such a speed I hardly have time to do something else before it is complete which is a great change of pace. I would say the Core i5-12600K is better geared for gaming and this is much more geared towards production or enthusiast class gaming. I highly recommend this processor or anything in the 12th gen Alder Lake family.

Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor16 (8P+8E) Cores up to 5.2 GHz Unlocked LGA1700 600 Series Chipset 125W,So many cores to use!,"I bought this instead of the 12th gen i7 anticipating future demand for more cores. There is a price difference to consider. As many know, more cores doesn't necessarily mean better. Games only use a max of 6 cores, though it may vary from game to game. If you just want to game, buy the i7 series. My 4790k had served me so well, it's still my backup on my old mobo. It's been at least 5 years since I bought ol' reliable. She's been through rough seas. It was time for her to rest easy. For the i9, in terms of gaming performance, only CPU heavy games like RTS games will see any benefit. Multi-tasking also sees benefit, though that's limited to the hard drive it's working off of. Still, I expect great things in the far future.

The 12700k is around two-thirds the cost and the difference in performance is only a few percent. Furthermore, you can get away with a moderate cooling solution on the 12700k whereas the 12900k really requires a top of the line cooler which will set you back even more. Even while using the NH-D15 CPU cooler I decided to underclock the 12900k a little bit in order to keep thermals in check, bringing the performance nearer to the 12700k.

Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor16 (8P+8E) Cores up to 5.2 GHz Unlocked LGA1700 600 Series Chipset 125W,Unit was previously opened....,"I've put together a few systems and run some retail 12900k chips so far and the 12900k is by far an amazingly fast CPU. Unfortunately this one I ordered from Amazon came already opened. As soon as I opened the shipping box I could tell it had been opened before. The edge was uneven and the label crease was loose. I put my X-acto Knife down (which is what you need or something similar to open these as the label is there for a reason) and with just the gentlest of pressure the label peeled away from the center where someone oh so nicely had finely cut the label horizontal to make it easy to fold one side back over the other and with just a quick once over it looked almost normal. If I hadn't opened a few of them already with Intel's fancy new packaging I probably would not have noticed but the way the packaging normally is, it is VERY precise, tight, even lines and you will not be easily or gently opening it up with a simple light finger pry. My biggest fear was there wasn't going to be a CPU in there at all but luckily the right CPU was in there that matched the container batch but if something is sold as new I don't do open boxes. Make sure to check your packages before opening. The seal should be nice and tight and straight. The edges of the back flap should be firm and secure against the other flap and the bottom line/edges should be even and exacting. Give a gentle pull on each corner of the box where the label keeps it sealed to make sure it hasn't been altered or tampered with. It should be VERY firm and unable to just pull open easily. Look at the condition of the box itself around that area and even the gold disk inside. Fresh, brand new i9 12900k's are very pristine and boxed with precision. Still, they are fantastic processors overall and a worthy upgrade from 10th and 11th gen.",16-Dec-21,1,Electrosoft,the United States,positive

While this probably can't multithread to the same degree, it does represent a lot of power and speed. 5.2GHz across 8 cores / 16 threads, on an air cooler and I'm not touching anything for OC...it's great as it is. Even the 'slow' cores clock in upwards of 4GHz, which the TR tapped out at best with 4.2 and that was only for a couple cores-worth. This one on air, does back off that max clock not soon afterwards; but I also have this in a 4u rack mounted case, with 4 chassis fans; vs the previous build which was on a 360 radiator/AIO, and had 13 system fans; but I was going for a rather ridiculous build with that vs this build I'm going for subtle/sleeper.

I have had the ryzen since launch. I was expecting similar performance maybe slightly better. However, this i5-13400f not only performs better than my old ryzen. It also does it at much cooler temps then the ryzen put out. My ryzen idled at 35c and got up to around 79c on heavy load. The i5 idles at 22c and has only gotten as high as 55c max under heavy land. That's 13 degrees cooler than the ryzen at idle and 24 degrees cooler under load. With that said that's a huge improvement over my old ryzen. Which I shouldn't be surprised that ryzen is a few generations old now. But damn. Definitely worth grabbing one.

I have installed it on an Asus Rog strig B660 F Wifi board, two nvme m2, (Kinston and Crucial), 6000 mh Corsair memory. The board, after the cold update of the bios, accepted the G3 processor without problem, the memory, after activating the bios tab, works at 6000 mh without problem. As I said, I bought it for video editing, I have been testing it with the integrated graphics (I haven't installed the dedicated one yet). I was pleasantly surprised, because with this configuration without integrated graphics, I created a 15 minute video, without transitions or anything, (it was a test), the raw video, after 3 or 4 minutes, finished video when with my old i7 took from half an hour to 45 minutes, I'm talking about a resolution of 1920x1080. I mean, he can handle it. Maybe the editing program also has something to do with it, which is not one of the cutting-edge ones that everyone mentions, but it is fantastic and does the same thing. I have been using the Magix editing program for a long time, if my old PC could, this one must have been able to do much more, as it has, since the program itself does not require so many resources. So far very happy. I have it with the heatsink that everyone hates, (the original one) that comes with the processor. When I edit at full speed I will see if it heats up or not, not at the moment. I simply want to give a slap on the wrist to whomever it may concern since the box arrived unsealed and to criticize it, Amazon has not published two reviews prior to its assembly. I forgot, I have mounted the processor with the suggestion plate that is sold separately and secures the processor with four screws to prevent it from bending.

SSE/AVX (so-called SIMD instructions) is a technology that subdivides the CPU's arithmetic register (recent ones are 256-512bit) according to the variable type (8-64bit) and parallelizes calculations. AVX256 calculates 32 8-bit variables in parallel, but AVX512 can calculate 64 in parallel. The performance of recent CPUs is almost entirely determined by the speed of AVX instructions. In particular, the superiority or inferiority of AVX instructions is clearly evident in the speed of video encoding and generation AI. Intel has been good at using AVX instructions since Haswell Refresh (4th generation), and it is good that it has high power saving performance because it drops to about 700MHz when idle (Ryzen is at most 1.4GHz). However, if you have a motherboard that does not have a power limit, you will have trouble cooling it. With a CPU cooler for TDP 65W, the thermal throttling will drop it to about 3.0GHz. Even so, it is impressive that it can achieve the above performance. If you attach a good CPU cooler, it will probably run at around 4.0GHz all the time. Intel, which makes a wide range of CPUs from Atom to Xeon, is also in the second generation of P-Core (specialized in single performance) and E-Core (focused on efficiency and multi-performance), which is a specialty of Intel. Although Intel tends to lag behind AMD and ARM in terms of manufacturing process (nm value), I think Intel is still superior in terms of architecture technology and instruction set. If you switch from Tiger Lake (11th generation) or below, doubling the performance is not a dream, so I am amazed at the progress of technology. The built-in GPU has 32 execution units (Tiger Lake's i5 1135G7 has 80), so it should be considered a bonus. If you are planning to play games at all, just add a video card. However, it is convenient to be able to output to a monitor even without a video card. Recently, even an i5 costs 35,000 yen due to the weak yen, so it's a difficult decision. In the past, I could have bought an i7 for the same price... These days, super cheap motherboards for around 5,000 yen are no longer available, and the cheapest ones cost 15,000 yen, so I ended up spending 50,000 yen just for the CPU + motherboard... Still, I think it was a good purchase. [Added 10/29/2023] The result of replacing the CPU cooler and breaking the TDP 65W restriction... I suppose it can't be helped, since it's essentially OCing a 65W rated CPU while ignoring the power limit, but when using a GIGABYTE B760M DS3H DDR4 with a TDP of 125W, operation becomes unstable when the CPU voltage exceeds 1.4V. It becomes stable when used with a TDP of 100W and a CPU voltage of about 1.3V. It's probably best not to use it on motherboards that like to overcharge the CPU voltage.",05-Aug-23,5,ITç¤¾ç•œ,Japan,competition sentiment

"Intel Core i3-13100 Desktop Processor 4 cores (4 P-cores + 0 E-cores) 12MB Cache, up to 4.5 GHz",Bought this processor and a cheap MATX motherboard so I could run MicroSquish Windoze 11,"So I was stuck on Windows 10 with my LGA 1151 core i7-6700.  This processor at an affordable price more than doubled, maybe tripled my cpu performance while still accepting my older DDR4 3200 ram and m.2 storage.  Also allows me to update my machine to Windows 11 as a 13th gen cpu.  I considered running 8th gen chip in my older mother board by flashing the bios with a coffee lake chip support, but rather than deal with all the isolation on the cpu pins and bios frustration, i opted to spend 60 bucks for a new MATX board and this cpu.  The only complaint I have is the cpu box was clearly opened and I am left wondering if this was dropped into someone else's board at some point and returned.  I don't like that when the product is being advertised as new.  The seller was Amazon LLC too so I am not sure what is going on with that.  I have half a mind to return it for a replacement but alas it is installed and seems to be running fine so I really don't want to pack it up and ship it back.  My chip runs pretty cool with the stock fan, 3d mark cpu stress tests never took it above 71C but that fan sure kicked in when the cpu was running at 100% utilization.  At idle on my computer the chip purrs along at 30-35C with the fan running somewhere around 40%.  All in all a good purchase to get my machine ready for Win 11.

The included fan was not spinning faster than about 600 RPM and luckily the processor throttled itself at 100C to prevent death. After taking the fan off and powering it separately it spun up to 3000RPM. I noticed that the wires were pinched along the heatsink because the housing was screwed down too tight. It happens. After fixing it and screwing it back on (not as tight) everything seems to be working.

The turboboost behavior is not what I'm used to. I do not recommend this one. The performance overall is better then the older ones ofcourse, but the powerlimits and frequencies are all over the place, and not how it should be on paper. Max turbo power should be 143Watts and all core turbo 4.1GHz . My sample's All core turbo didn't go above 3.9GHz and the power draw didn't went above 80 watts. and that's lower then previous gens.

The packaging is simple, no irrelevant information and it had an appealing effect on me. The processor came with a boxed cooler, i.e. with a matching air cooler. Inserting it onto the mainboard is very easy and the feel is very appealing. As always, the product name and clock frequency are shown on the processor. The CPU has no real competition in its price range that offers similar performance. The price is also very reasonable. I particularly like the division of the processor cores, which also performs the PC's tasks well separately, which also got the maximum performance out of it. The processor does not have a graphics unit due to the -F designation. The frequency of the processor is quite high and also offers very satisfactory performance here. I can only get the CPU to half capacity under very difficult conditions. My only criticism here is the air cooler. The CPU doesn't get too hot with it, but it is quite loud and because of that I would recommend a different air cooler or, even better, a water cooler. Overall a very good product and one that I would recommend!",20-Jun-23,5,Erdem GÃ¶ren,Germany,positive
"Intel Core I5-13400F Processor 20M Cache, Up to 4.60 Ghz, LGA 1700",good evolution of the 12400f with 4 more Echores,"I'm trying it now that I'm writing this review, I find that it has the same performance as its predecessor, the 12400f, with 100Mhz more that isn't even noticeable, perhaps with the slightly improved architecture it seems more responsive to me, but it's probably a sensation, data in hand we are there. Like the 12400f but with 4 more Ecore which probably in a production environment give that extra bit of calculation which doesn't hurt. So 10 cores and 16 threads with a 4Ghz clock in gaming is very good. As always, very armored, it is not unlocked, only the RAM frequencies can be adjusted, the processor is and will remain, in this case Intel has unfortunately always been very stingy , either you get the K series or you don't change a single thing. Apart from this philosophical-commercial choice, this processor is a blast, with a 3070 everything runs well and for the handful of watts it consumes it doesn't even heat up much. I got it at one time on offer for â‚¬180 and I believe that in the near future it will drop to these figures, for a so-called ""entry level"" gaming PC at that price it is a good deal.",26-Mar-24,5,Alessandro,Italy,competition sentiment

But the Raptor was as rare as hens teeth in retail, supposedly kept for the OEM market and for slightly more power and without a boxed cooler. Well what did I get? The Raptor around 5% quicker than Alder, anything quicker in pc gaming is a plus. Lol You can also recognize Stepping B0 (Raptor Lake) in a better catalog by the S-Spec code, which is SRMBG. It differs from Stepping C0 (Alder Lake, S-Spec code SRMBN) in the last letter of the designation â€“ â€œGâ€ instead of â€œNâ€ Check the CPU die as per my picture.

However, the higher power consumption, price tag, and potential thermal issues require careful consideration. Overall Rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars (with a slight temperature-related deduction) Should You Buy It? Absolutely! If you're a hardcore gamer or demanding content creator seeking the best value for performance in the mid-range, and aren't afraid of a little thermal taming, the 13600K is a top contender. Consider alternatives: If budget, power consumption, or Windows 10 compatibility are major concerns, explore Ryzen 5 options or consider the slightly less powerful (and cooler) i5-13500.",04-Jan-24,3,Dylin,the United States,positive
"Intel Core i5-13600K Desktop Processor 14 cores (6 P-cores + 8 E-cores) 24M Cache, up to 5.1 GHz' Socket LGA 1700",Amazing CPU for gaming,"There's really not much that needs to be said. If you're upgrading to 13th gen Intel, and don't require the additional non-gaming related benefits of 13700k or 13900k, you can't go wrong with the i5-13600k. Even with XMP enabled to 6000Mhz & a Noctua NH-U12A tower cooler on top, this beast never gets truly hot in any game. Granted, I have a very good case for airflow, but regardless it's extremely rare I ever see this CPU hitting the 70's when gaming (this includes 1440p gaming at basically maxed settings), with plenty of utilization headroom on top of that. I paired this beastly CPU with the Sapphire Nitro Plus Radeon 6950XT & have been having an amazing experience all around. If you're deeply considering 13th gen, & your main focus is gaming, then the 13600k will perform up there with the best without all the additional heat the higher end SKU's give off. Genuinely give this CPU a 10/10, never in my life did I ever anticipate an i5 to be this great, but just goes to show it's more about the generation and less about the number after the i. If you're considering the CPU but unsure as to its performance, I promise you wont be disappointed with it one bit. Including with its temperatures.

I stood up a Plex docker container and added my footage and this CPU handles transcoding and streaming my videos no problem and it's great to go back and easily re-live some of those storms. We also have a growing library of TV shows and Movies and it also handles streaming those as well.

At 70 fewer watts than the i9-13900K you can actually cool the thing on air and enjoy similar single core performance, and with a respectable multicore performance score as well. My chip actually runs faster than Passmark says it should, but that might be because of my RAM. I got the K chip to get faster DDR5 speeds, not faster clock speeds, since I'm on air cooled, but at 5.1GHz I'm not for want of more cycles. My last CPU was an AMD Ryzen 7 4750G. Respectable for its day, but when I saw the performance of this Intel I decided it was time for me to switch back. My recommendation is that if you're running an air cooled gaming system, strongly consider this chip even if you have the cash for a 13th gen i9.

First of all, this processor offers solid performance for everyday tasks and gaming. Single-core performance is good, and the multi-threaded capability helps handle heavier workloads efficiently. I've noticed a significant improvement over my old processor, resulting in a smoother and more responsive experience. However, I must point out that the price of this processor is a bit high for the year 2023. With the rapid evolution of technology, it is possible to find processors with similar performance at a lower price. If you're looking for a budget-friendly processor, it might be a good idea to consider other options on the market. Additionally, it is important to note that this processor is based on the Alder Lake architecture, which is relatively new. This means there may be compatibility issues or adjustments needed for some older software or games. Be sure to check compatibility with your setup before purchasing. In conclusion, the Intel Core i5-13500 processor provides satisfactory performance for daily tasks and gaming. However, the high price compared to other options on the market and possible compatibility issues may be factors to consider. If you're willing to invest in a latest generation processor, it will meet your performance needs, but it may be wise to consider other options if you're looking for better value.",25-Sep-23,5,Sam,France,positive
"Intel Core i5-13500 Processor, LGA 1700, 24M Cache, up to 4.80 GHz",Multithreaded beast that fears NOTHING,"Processor with a quality/price ratio that touches Olympus: a beast that crushes any application or game or work you give it. Even in terms of temperatures we are there (if you activate the E-CORE in the bios it starts to heat up... even if using a tower heatsink with two fans I have never exceeded 85 degrees, not even in this sultry summer). Be careful to set the BIOS well for this beast, I'll write you some precautions to take to avoid problems: 1) pay attention to the power profile of the CPU, if you leave it as is you will have a PL1 of 115w and a PL2 of 254w (depends on the manufacturer of the card mother, but for better or worse the values â€‹â€‹are these), the processor will heat up a lot... I set the INTEL profile (you can find it among those available in the bios), so I have PL1 65w and PL2 154w and by testing I discovered that I did not having lost performance in any way (at most 2/3fps less but I still sleep at night). 2) IF YOU HAVE AMD GPU: to activate the RESIZABLE BAR in the bios you must first enable the ''above 4g decoding'' item, restart the PC again by accessing the bios and then activate the ''resizable bar''... if not do this, it may happen that the board is unable to apply the changes to these two variables at the same time and you will be stuck in a BOOTLOOP (to get out of it just reset the bios by shorting the two pins on the motherboard).

"Intel Core i5-13500 Processor, LGA 1700, 24M Cache, up to 4.80 GHz",Top quality-price processor,"The best quality-price processor in the mid-range. You have the i5-12400F which is the best value for money if you want something cheaper. The i5-13500 (this processor), if you need more power, is the best value for money in this price range, and if you want something even more powerful (a little more) there is the i5-13600KF.  These 3 are the best processors in the mid-high quality-price range. That said, this i5-13500 has very good temperatures, with a â‚¬40 Thermalright Assassin SE heatsink it is always at 26 degrees, playing at 30-40 degrees and working hard at 50-60. When you do stress tests and put the processor at maximum for 10 minutes, the temperature is 75-80 degrees. This also depends on other factors such as the box and the ambient temperature, but in no case is it a hot processor, with â‚¬40 you cool this bug. It comes with a heatsink in the box (the one from Intel), but I don't recommend it if you're going to put a lot of effort into it, as it gets very hot, around 20-30 degrees more. The cinebench test gives me a result of almost 21000 points, currently placing it just below the i7-12700 if I'm not mistaken, a much more expensive processor that, as you can see, has practically the same power. Conclusion: Top quality-price processor. I recommend purchasing the i5-12400F, i5-13500 or i5-13600kf depending on budget.

It's always been quite simple with these Intel heatsinks but I don't know about this one, the pistons didn't fit properly, once they entered they didn't engage, you can't understand the direction of the 4 pins. In short, something shameless. Really unthinkable. I grabbed a Noctua that wasn't too expensive. CPU result under maximum stress at 73Â°C. Temperature now as I write 27Â°.

I paired it with a ROG STRIX B760-F GAMING WIFI motherboard, 32GB of Vengeance DDR5 5600MHz RAM and an RTX 4070 graphics card. To maintain optimal temperatures, I opted for a BeQuiet Pure Loop water cooling system 360mm and a TD500 Mesh V2 case which includes 3 stock fans installed on the front, and I also added an additional fan on the back. I must say that it works wonderfully on all games. The performance is really powerful and smooth. I was pleasantly surprised by the heat management, as temperatures did not rise excessively high. However, I think it is important to note that this can vary depending on the system configuration and the size of the cooling system used. I might recommend being careful if you are considering using a smaller sized watercooler.

"Intel Core i5-13600KF Desktop Processor 14 cores (6 P-cores + 8 E-cores) 24M Cache, up to 5.1 GHz' LGA 1700",The performance bargain of the century.,"I won't go into much technical detail here since there's people a lot smarter than myself who can get into the nitty gritty. Generally speaking though - this CPU absolutely smokes, especially for the price. Don't let the 'i5' name fool you. The i5-13600K (and KF) is a top-class processor that for most users, will offer more than enough performance for intensive tasks while having probably the most reasonable power consumption and cooling requirements of the top-three 13th generation Intel processors. I came from an i7-5960X - still a solid processor in this day and age but unfortunately my motherboard wasn't exactly kind to me attempting to take it above 3.8 GHz. Despite it bottlenecking against my 2080 Ti, it still ran cool under a 360mm CLC, topping out at no more than 51 degrees C gaming (GPU load) and 60 degrees under full CPU loads. But since the current market for new components is pretty good, I opted to go all in on a 13th gen build rather than find a better X99 motherboard. Odds are, you're probably going to be cross shopping the i5-13600K with the i7-13700K and the i9-13900K. Unless your workflow necessitates the additional core count or you're chasing records, the performance difference between those CPUs and the 13600K did not seem worth the hundreds of dollars of additional cost and the massive increase in peak power consumption. Power also equals heat, and that was another motivating factor for going with the 13600K, having been accustomed to a relatively cool and quiet build for some time. That said; with the additional cores and much higher boost frequency, I was expecting higher peak power draw and temps despite a lower TDP on paper. And they were definitely higher, under the same 360mm CLC. After running benchmarks with Cinebench and 3DMark, I was hitting peak temps in the mid-to-high 70s under full CPU loads. Gaming loads however were definitely more manageable though, sitting in the 40s and seldom breaking 50 degrees, which was actually a small but appreciable improvement over the 5960X. I'd advise at minimum a high quality air cooler or a 240mm CLC for this processor. The out of the box performance is something else though. I managed to hit 23345 on a multi-core Cinebench test and a 16459 combined score on 3DMark Time Spy. Again, this is stock clocks paired with an overclocked 2080 Ti and 32GB of DDR5 at 5600 MHz. At 3440 x 1440 and 144Hz, games run like butter. I could dabble in overclocking it since I have the headroom but honestly, I don't see the point. It's fantastic as is. All in all, I feel like the 13600K is kind of the no-brainer option for most people looking to put together a high-end system on a budget. You're getting most of the performance of it's more expensive stablemates for a much lower price and less obnoxiously high power and cooling requirements. The KF is also a little cheaper if you don't need integrated graphics. Just buy it. You'll love it.",22-Feb-23,5,YALE70,the United States,competition sentiment

Some pros and cons.  My specs: RTX 4070ti,  z790 ddr5 gigabyte mobo, 32 gb fury ram, 1tb WD black SSD gen 4. Pros: More cores Noticeably faster in some areas like booting and some applications. Some triple A GPU bound games will get a noticeable FPS boost. (Not huge, talking 3-10 at most). CPU bound games (emulators for me) will get much better stability and cpu usage reduction. Cons: If you are looking for energy efficiency these 13th gen and higher chips are NOT it. More cores means more energy draw for sure. On Triple A games the chip is using 20-30 watts more electricity. In emulators like RPCS3 itâ€™s nearly double. I went from 30- 40 watt average to average 80 and in some instances spiked above 100. The good thing is emulators are much less GPU bound so the wattage balances out, sort of. Heat- Iâ€™m running an AIO lian li 360 Galahad, with the 12400f I was nearly always running at room temp (my house gets lots of shade and stays cool/cold) so I was used to 22c range. With the 13600k you  will see a 10 degree increase even at idle. Emulators will get into the 60s while triple A games 40s and 50s. With the 12400f my fan curve rarely ever triggered high fan speeds. With the 13th gen you will definitely hear those fans work at load. Side notes I tried the 13600k on two mobos (z790 and 690) you can use it on older 690 compatible mobos, you just need to flash bios to latest. It was super easy on the gigabyte z790 and 690 mobo. Overall. The performance jump is noticeable in some games. But far more noticeable is the increase in heat and wattage usage. If you have a 12th gen and are on the fence you really donâ€™t need to upgrade, however depending on what you are doing with it could be the main factor. I wanted my RPCS3 to run at 60fps in 4k constantly and the 13600k did the trick.

Energy efficiency compared to my old CPU is of course not justifiable in today's times. 30 watts more isn't much on paper, but if you add it up over the year, it adds up to a lot. 10 hours in operation, 6 of which are under load. I'd rather not do the math haha. I'm not even going to start with any dubious and pointless comparisons to AMD, they're making enough mistakes so there's no need to talk about it. All in all, a very good all-rounder, as always, good work from Intel. The next generation just needs to tweak the power consumption a bit.",18-Sep-23,5,S,Germany,positive

Most motherboards support processors up to the 12th generation and you need to update the bios of the various models. I had several difficulties from this point of view!! Then I understood. So I bought an Asus motherboard already updated to support the 13th generation. Two 16 GB Kingston Fury DDR4 3200 RAM sticks.

This 13th gen i7 K is officially Intel's fourth fastest CPU on paper but in real life it's the fastest of them all in terms of stability as the the three slated above it (13900k,14700k and 14900k) are all plagued with issues that Intel won't discuss but admits to, albeit grudgingly. Until a fix-all patch is released, the 13700k is the best choice for gamers and content creators who won't be bothered with unpredictable bugs and BSOD fests. What good is it having a Ferrari but with an engine that's goes offline 20 times a day?  May as well go with a Porsche that works. At that level of performance these high-end CPU's more or less all perform equal (or would if they all worked properly), but it's easy to understand the frustration of owners whose 30-day window for return to Amazon is closed.",13-Jun-24,5,Karl K.,Canada,competition sentiment

According to HWMonitor, the CPU package hovers around 15W power consumption doing desktop tasks (web browsing / email / Office). Compared to my i7-6700K (video card and PSU unchanged; new motherboard, ram, and heatsink&fan): - System power consumption at idle and doing desktop tasks is about 5W higher than my 6700K in normal mode, or about 15W lower in â€œecoâ€ mode in my motherboardâ€™s settings - Synthetic benchmarks (3dmark CPU Profile) indicate 2x performance for single-core processing and 4x performance for maximum threads - Real-life video encoding is roughly 3x faster using PowerDirector Note that this LGA1700 socket is known to allow some bending (this causes poorer contact with heatsink which may cause throttling). This can be remedied by installing a pressure plate (I bought a Thermalright LGA1700-BCF for around $12).

In general - all mentioned in this review products are as described and working as described. Almost all deserve 5 stars (commented if one or more stars are taken off). Instead of reviewing item by item I decided to write one review for all products used for one specific PC build. The purpose of this PC build - fancy compact gaming system. Items used in this build: -- Item 1) OCPC Mini ITX Case, Hydra Italy Mini ITX PC Case, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BK6D77DG/ Very good case â€“ compact, cool looking and efficient. The black color is the only variant I found on Amazon. With only cooling from top-down CPU cooler, the i7-13700K based system passed the stress test very well. Riser cable is not included â€“ actually the riser cable for GPU orientation as shown on Amazon item photo does not exist. In order to build the system as shown, I bought a flexible riser cable (Item #2) and twisted it to 180Â°. Another simpler solution is to install GPU upside down as presented by other reviewers on Amazon. -- Item 2) EZDIY-FAB PCIE 4.0 16x Extreme High Speed Flexible Riser Cable PCI Express Port GPU Extension Card-Dual Reverse Connector for ITX [21cm]. Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09S5DW3RX/ -Does the job - exactly what I need for the project. Note: During system build I have to remove the bracket from the cable male connector and install it back after passing cable through the case hole. -- Item 3) Power supply: Cooler Master V750 SFX Gold Full Modular, 750W, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08LP7B7FM/ - Works as supposed to. PSU had a noticeable burning smell for about 5 days, considering this is normal for a new PSU. If you want to build more powerful gaming system, I recommend the PCIe 5.0 ready 850W SFX PSU, something like ARESGAME GL850 https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CHDS4J33/ SFX-L PSU will work in Hydra Mini as well, but cable management will be tougher. -- Item 4) CPU: Intel Core i7-13700K, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BCF57FL5/ - Good CPU, working well in gaming. -- Item 5) Motherboard: ASUS ROG Strix B760-I Gaming WiFi, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BR8TVLPL/ - Working as described, nice looking MB. Thank you, ASUS - now ROG motherboards have the Memtest86+ built in BIOS. This very helpful feature allows PC builders to check memory before operating system installation and prevent blue screens and failures during OS install and system use in case of defective memory. In my case originally ordered CORSAIR DOMINATOR PLATINUM RGB DDR5 RAM 64GB (2x32GB) 6400MHz (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C1R95SPW/) was defective. Both memory modules came to life and showed ok in BIOS but Memtest86+ got errors. I did test modules one by one in the same memory slot and found out that one of the modules is the cause of the failures. Returned the defective memory and bought another from a different brand (Item #6). ASUS ROG Motherboard chosen for the look. In my opinion the best Intel (or may be overall) mini ITX MB on the market is MSI MPG Z790I Edge WiFi Gaming Motherboard (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BHCJ6KQ2/ ) I own one and have a very best experience. -- Item 6) Memory: TEAMGROUP T-Force Delta RGB DDR5 Ram 64GB (2x32GB) 6000MHz, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BNTV1945/ -Very good product, works as described, nice looking, recognized by Aura Sync. -- Item 7) Graphics Card: MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16GB, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CCFZMHSM/ - Graphics card work as supposed to, have low power consumption. This GPU was chosen for the look only. Anyway, the presented system can play all modern games well at 1440p. But if you want the very good gaming experience, I will recommend at least RTX 4070 Ti like MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Ventus 2X 12G OC. And the very best (talking about built on Hydra Italy Mini Case) will be the system with 850W PCIe 5.0 SFX PSU and: a) Â MSI MPG Z790I Edge WiFi Gaming Motherboard, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BHCJ6KQ2/ b) Intel Core i9-13900KF, Â https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BCFM3CJ4/ c) ASUS ProArt GeForce RTXâ„¢ 4080 16GB OC, ( Amazon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C75J66C8/). This compact GPU has included Graphics Card Holder which will work with presented builtI own all of these (a,b,c) components packed in another fancy mini ITX case (Phanteks PH-ES217A_BK02 Evolv Shift 2 Air Mini-ITX case, Fabric Side Panels) and they performed superb in games. -- Item 8) SSD Disks: 8.1) Primary (system): WD_BLACK 2TB SN850X NVMe Gen4 PCIe M.2 2280 WDS200T2X0E, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B7CMZ3QH/ 8.2) Secondary (backup and media data): Crucial P3 Plus 4TB PCIe Gen4 NVMe M.2 CT4000P3PSSD8, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B25M8FXX/ - Very good products, works as described, no problems. -- Item 9) Antec Power Supply Sleeved Cable, PSU Cables, PSU Extension Cable Kit / 1x24pin ATX / 2x8pin (4+4) EPS / 3X (6+2) pin PCI-E,",08-Jan-24,5,Andrey,the United States,competition sentiment

However, even when set to 190W (same as the i7 12700K), it is an amazing CPU that surpasses the i9 12900K, and the performance drop itself is only a few percent, so I (simple water cooling) am satisfied with running it at 190W. If you absolutely want to use it with air cooling (large), I think that around 140W will be able to cool it without any problems and it will be much stronger than the i7 12700K and run it at low power.

I use it on a Z690 motherboard, and there is no problem as long as the BIOS is compatible. Recent motherboards can update the BIOS with just a power supply, so even non-compatible BIOS is often not a problem. I recommend updating device drivers to the latest version in advance (or downloading them for new installations). The CinebenchR23 score is 30552 for multi and 2082 for single. The score is about 10% higher than the Core i9-12900K, and the power consumption at full load is about 30W lower, which is good. I think it is doing well with the 10nm process rule, which is two to three generations lower than other companies' current products, but the fact that a 360mm simple water cooler is necessary remains the same as Alder Lake, so opinions will be divided. To be honest, the watt performance at full load is a bit iffy. This time I installed it for a gaming PC, so I'm not going to be encoding videos, so I'm personally very satisfied. If you're mainly using it for encoding, I recommend the older Ryzen 9 5950X, which works fine with a large air-cooled cooler, but is easy to use and has a low price.

Average of about 100 watts and computer overall idles @ 65 watts, which is 25 watts less than my old i7 4th gen. No need to undervolt this CPU, even though you can, you'll just be giving yourself future headaches if you do. During the Cinebench stress test you get temps that max out at 98 - 100 degrees Celsius, but remember that's absolute max mode, 99% of users will never use this CPU for more than several minutes at. If Intel's Extreme Tuning Utility does not automatically download when installing, definitely get it from intels website and learn to use it. It is easy to use, and you won't regret it. I just use it for monitoring performance, but you can use it for easy optimize and under/overvolt with too, but I'd recommend doing any of that through your motherboard BIOS if you decide to. Most new BIOS's are easier and safer for that kind of stuff anyway. Do your research on which to use and how.

I purchased the most up to date CPU and other components with the hope this one will last me as long as the last one did. Overall I think this is a great CPU, however it is a bit frustrating when you try to cool these things. Intel just keeps pushing these CPUs harder and harder to try and beat the performance metrics of AMD, but in the process they are making CPUs that are anywhere from near impossible to difficult at best to keep cool. After a lot of tweaking in the BIOS I finally got this one to stay below the 90 degree Celsius threshold, but that doesn't account for how hot it still makes my room when I'm gaming. The extra heat was kind of nice during the winter months, but as summer is approaching I'm wondering how this is going to pan out... Anyway, the CPU is completely as advertised and worked flawlessly out of the box. I didn't run into any errors or issues with this CPU. Overall I 100% recommend it because Intel has never let me down. I've been building my own systems for more than 20 years now too, so that's a pretty long track record of CPUs that just worked and never died.

I'm a sysadmin by trade, so remoting in and fixing servers has never been an issue with that processor..but for gaming..Titles like Cyberpunk, Days Gone, to even WoW..there were areas that my 3080 was being bottlenecked by the 9900k. I coupled this CPU with a MSI EDGE z790 DDR4 (I have fantastic Samsung B-Die CL14 3600 DDR4 from the previous build). So far, in Cyberpunk I'm seeing 25-30 more FPS on 1440p Ultra settings w/ Raytraycing on High. WoW is getting 50+ more FPS, and I'm getting over 100 FPS in Valdrakken, where I was getting 45-50 FPS with the 9900k with the same settings as cyberpunk (1440p ultra (10 graphics settings). I'm using the Corsair iCUE H100i Elite LCD 240mm AIO, with Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut Extreme thermal paste to cool this bad boy, and even at prolonged sessions in Cyberpunk, my temps are not getting above 65c.

"Intel Core I7-13700K Processor 30M Cache, Up to 5.40 Ghz, LGA 1700","ðŸš€ PERFORMANCE, AT THE RIGHT PRICE ðŸš€","ðŸ‘‰ I'll start with the CONCLUSIONS: it's a truly remarkable CPU, I own a couple of 12900k on other builds but this 13700k is better performing in some respects. I am NOT a gamer and use PCs for work. My experience is therefore aimed at professionals who work with videos, photos, 3D reconstructions, 3D editing, photogrammetry, etc. etc. Of course, unlike the 12900k (on MoBo Asus ProArt Z690-CREATOR WIFI with DeepCool LS720 and Asus ROG STRIX Z690-A GAMING WIFI D4 with ITEK EVOLIQ 240 ARGB both with the Thermalright frame) which when mounted without touching the Bios do not fire absurd watts (but I think it depends more on the bios than on the CPU), this 12700k (on MoBo Asus ProArt b760-CREATOR WIFI with Noctua NH-D15 chromax.black and Thermalright frame), heats up a little more. Instead, compared to the 13900k, also reviewed here on Amazon, I didn't want to intervene in the bios also because after the first few minutes in the stress tests, for example with Cinebench 23, during which the bios always pushes the processor to the limit (over 360 Watts) , everything calms down. The boost lasts a few moments and immediately afterwards the consumption stands at 253 Watts, consequently the temperatures also drop, so much so that the average core temperatures hardly exceed 90 degrees (in the 10 minute test) âš–ï¸ The processor offers truly excellent performance, all programs run smoothly, thanks also to the 64 GB of memory. The Adobe suite, from Photoshop to After Effects, from Illustrator to Premiere Pro, Blender, Cinema 4D and Metashape Pro (i.e. the programs I use most) are supported by so much power and have no hesitations. Even with several applications open the 13700k works great. ðŸš€ On Cinebench r23 the score is 28550 on the single render, maximum temperatures of cores 4, 5 and 7 (the hottest) of 100Â° while in the 10 min throttling test the score was 27497 with maximum temperatures of 100Â° respectively for core 3, 5 and 7c. A difference of only 3.69% between the single render and the throttling test. Not bad! In the 10 min throttling test, the maximum values â€‹â€‹of the individual cores vary between 93Â° and 100Â°, while the average values â€‹â€‹between 83Â°-85Â°, therefore more than acceptable. The maximum consumption is 351 Watts while the average consumption is 260 Watts. At idle temperatures vary between 21Â° and 47Â°. You can check from the photos ðŸ˜¬. Let's now move on to the other info: ðŸš› SHIPPING: Perfect, like the entire Amazon purchase process. The times were respected and the packaging was adequate. ðŸ“¦ PACKAGE AND CONTENTS: The packaging, compared to the more famous 13900, is almost poor. The CPU is located inside a cardboard box protected by the classic plastic case. ðŸª› INSTALLATION: Very simple. The only precaution is to identify the small triangle on the CPU, at the bottom left, and position it in correspondence with the triangle visible on the socket fixing support on the MoBo. Personally, to avoid the bending phenomenon that can occur on the LGA 1700 socket, I used the Thermalright frame. ðŸ”´ USEFUL INFO: Many recommend using an AIO of at least 240, which is reliable and powerful.

"Intel Core I7-13700K Processor 30M Cache, Up to 5.40 Ghz, LGA 1700","A step forward: it doesn't heat up, remarkable performance without OC, excellent for gaming","PACKAGING As Intel tradition teaches, for some series now, all the processors are placed inside a small cardboard box. On the outside, the main information that is good to know about the processor is shown, as well as some important information such as reference numbers. To get a detailed product sheet, simply go to the manufacturer's website to get all the details. Even the inside of the package has remained practically the same tradition / philosophy, where the processor itself is contained inside a plastic container, which in turn is blocked by the cardboard of the package, so as to avoid a possible fall during Furthermore, the shipping of the item, as the external structure is made of cardboard but the plastic part is placed only in the centre, cushions any impacts during transport. The classic manual is also supplied with attached sticker to apply to your case with this new series, i.e. the 13th. DESCRIPTION OF THE ITEM Coming from a 9 series, more precisely i7-9700K, this i7-13700K series can only be a decided step forward. In fact, my previous processor had 8 cores and 8 threads instead of this one which has 16 cores and 24 threads. Furthermore, it can be defined as a split processor as there are 8 performance cores (P-Core) and 8 efficient cores (E-Core). The former can reach a maximum speed of 5.4 Ghz, while the efficient cores 4.2 Ghz. The base frequency for efficient cores is 2.5 Ghz. The base power of the processor is 125W but can reach 253W in turbo. Obviously, the management of whether to use efficient or power cores is given by the operating system and the workload that is required. If the bios is equipped with it (like mine in this case) it is in fact possible to deactivate the E-Core or always bring them to their maximum speed. However, I strongly advise against doing this soft-overclock as with these new generation processors it is completely ""useless"" given the monstrous performance they can offer, so as to avoid compromising their reliability. In fact, I have personally contested that on very heavy games and environments, the automatic management is absolutely perfect, allowing truly low working temperatures and truly remarkable performance. To give an example, on FiveM, using V-Sync (and a 2070S as GPU) with FPS blocked at 75, the latter never drop below this threshold but on the contrary, tend to increase slightly. With the previous configuration there were multiple frame drops. I have had the opportunity to observe the same thing on a competitive game, such as Fortnite, by blocking the FPS at 144 and the latter remain stable at this threshold without ever dropping and without even the slightest lag occurring which would be detrimental to a game. where speed is key. The work that has been done on these new CPUs is simply remarkable, I was really surprised by the speed in doing the operations since it is really very fast to do everything, but especially surprising on the performance that occurs on the gaming side. I would add that my tests were performed on the latest 22H2 build of Windows 11. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, I am absolutely satisfied with this processor. I would also like to underline that all my tests were carried out with a ""dated"" RAM of only 2667 Mhz. For this processor, a frequency of at least 3200 MHz is recommended for DDR4 and obviously widely supports DDR5 RAM which reaches even higher speeds than the previous series. However, despite this ""problem"", since it is not a problem, the performances that I was able to observe also through benchmarks are very respectable. Obviously, since this is a new processor that has just been released, we will have to wait a bit before Windows in particular is updated as best as possible to fully exploit the power offered by this processor. At the same time, it is really difficult to find one at a fair price. In my case, considering that my previous processor broke, I had to immediately find a quick replacement. Having paid around 500 euros (a little less), I can say that the price is absolutely in line with the quality ratio of the product offered and obviously taking into consideration that this is a series presented only at the end of October 2022 and certainly a product that will be valid for the next few years.

"Intel Core I7-13700K Processor 30M Cache, Up to 5.40 Ghz, LGA 1700",Excellent gaming performance and energy efficiency,"The Intel I7-13700K processor from the Raptor Lake series and with LGA1700 socket indicates in its name the 13th generation (circa 2022) and which is factory unlocked for overclocking its frequencies, an activity that is always risky for anyone who is not really expert. It has 16 cores and a frequency ranging from 3.2Ghz to 5.4Ghz with TurboBoost and an energy requirement of only 125W and integrates a video card that is excellent for basic tasks (navigation, Office, video streaming, light graphics processing). It natively supports DDR5 RAM modules, solving the (few) problems present with the past generation. I chose this processor to completely replace my old PC that was over 10 years old, mainly for gaming. I come from the same model, obviously older and with less Core. Personally I think that this CPU is very solid, stable and high-performance for long gaming sessions and I prefer it over the higher-end Intel I9-13xxx due to better multicore management during games. In fact, I believe that the I9 processor was designed for tasks other than gaming and I wanted a product that was as optimized as possible in terms of pure performance and use/cost ratio. Both with a sata SSD and with an M2 Windows boots and is operational in 20 seconds (having disabled the function that never turns off the PC, so the boot is real starting from a complete shutdown state). Any recent video game manages the Cores without problems and the processor itself ""turns off"" those not necessary for the task carried out. Even with those games requiring high-end hardware as a suggested requirement for an optimal experience, this CPU fits the bill well - and will for a very long time. By way of comparison, my old Intel I7-3700 was able to handle and launch any video game released from 2013 to today without ever slowing down or heating up excessively and I have no doubt that with this modern and updated version it is the same. One small thing to watch out for: the CPU gets hot. It's not its flaw but its operating temperature, especially after hours of gaming. Be prepared for its premature demise if inadequately cooled and/or placed in small homes. My model was not boxed (therefore sold without a fan) and I turned to a well-known brand famous in the industry to purchase the dedicated fan. In conclusion, perhaps I also obtained the same performance with a CPU from the I5-135xx family which has always had a good quality/price ratio, but I wanted to exaggerate to be comfortable with the specifications of the games to come. In my opinion, for a gamer it is a must have, even in comparison with the brand new AMD 7000.

On the processor side it is very powerful but energy intensive (peak consumption around 250w) and consequently temperatures reach 100 C.

"Intel Core I7-13700K Processor 30M Cache, Up to 5.40 Ghz, LGA 1700",Is it worth upgrading from the 8700k?,"I thought long and hard about whether an upgrade from my trusty 8700k would even make sense. With 90% gaming and 10% work, I mainly looked at game performance comparisons. In my resolution of 3440x1440 and 2560x1440, the processor plays a minor role, so my 2080Ti graphics card should be replaced first, but with my 8700k that would have led to a bottleneck. So I decided to buy the 13700k + MSI z790 Gaming Edge motherboard to be prepared for a new graphics card in the future. The first thing I noticed was how hot the 13700k is in comparison, my 8700k was decapitated and ran at a maximum of 60-65 degrees under full load. The 13700k, on the other hand, without OC of course, ran straight towards 100 degrees in the first benchmarks, phew. The thing is an absolute performance monster as I found out in the ""3D Mark"" benchmark. In some cases even first place with my hardware combination. It just pulls over 253W and more and that's where the BIOS comes into play. I can only advise you to reduce the power limits, lower the temp limits, regulate core voltage, etc. It still delivers great performance and there are enough optimization options. My min. FPS and frame times have improved so much that a game that delivers almost the same avg FPS feels like a new game. Absolutely crazy and I would not have expected that, and that at my resolution. At the moment it is still running on Windows 10 for me, but Windows 11 should be preferred due to the better communication with the processor and its E cores, which have been tuned to that very operating system. An absolute monster for â‚¬450, whether you want it to be efficient or power hungry is up to you, it can do anything. But get a decent cooling system for it, mine is all cooled by a custom water cooling system. Take care and goodbye.",29-Jan-23,5,Carinthian Oak,Germany,competition sentiment

Needless to say, it's quite unusual. I installed it on an Asus TUF Gaming Z790-PLUS motherboard (just to have the latest chipset), without any problem. The price is high and what's more it is delivered without a cooler. Bad point from Amazon... Delivery was done securely (with a code to give to the delivery person) but the packaging was non-existent (an envelope). I clearly saw that the box containing the processor had ""suffered"" the hardships of delivery, but the main object was not damaged. I knew it was heating up quite a bit, so for the first time I installed watercooling for the processor. In this case a Thermaltake Toughliquid 360 (provide the corresponding case for the internal dimensions). In normal use it does not exceed 35Â° and pushed during fairly demanding gaming sessions (Cyberpunk 2077 / Forza Horizon 5...) we have a very reasonable temperature of less than 60Â°. I remember that my old i5 mentioned above could go up to +80Â° (with a slight overclock of +15%). I took the K version (and not KF) for two reasons: - The possibility of overclocking it very easily with the Asus motherboard, without exceeding reasonable limits (and therefore extending its useful life) - use it in case the graphics card breaks down (which happened to me precisely when I had the GTX1080...

For gaming, performance compared to the i7 12700k is noted, but at what price. A temperature rising to 35 degrees at rest compared to the i7 12700k at 25 degrees. In games you need to count 20 degrees more compared to the i7 12700k, so around 70 to 80 degrees depending on the processor's load. Pay attention to your cooling, count on a high-end 360 mini to benefit from maximum heating but with all the potential of the i7 13700k, but only with as standard which is already enormous. For games, small difference in its latency which is better therefore better image rendering observed with an nvidia rtx 4080 graphics card depending on the games (zero or even 20 fps for some at max) but be careful with your watercooling so as not to suffer from nuisances and to specify an increasing watt consumption. Recommended processor for a new configuration for those who measure temperature and its usefulness in watts.

However, buyers should be aware that the Core i7-13700KF does not come with integrated graphics. For users who require onboard video capabilities, the slightly higher-priced Core i7-13700K would be the best choice. The absence of integrated graphics in the 13700KF model can be a significant consideration for those who don't plan to use a dedicated graphics card.

But let's proceed in order: ðŸ“¦ Packaging and shipping: as always with Amazon, shipments arrived on time with packaging suitable for the product. It is Intel's practice to use cardboard boxes to contain their processors which obviously have their own hard plastic case (maybe just the i9s have another one, but I'm not sure). inside the box together with the product there is its own booklet and various documentation. âš™ï¸ Performance: a bomb. As already said, in my case my generational leap has certainly made the difference, but in any case we are talking about a high-level product. I use it both for gaming and for work (rendering, 3D modeling, graphics) and in both cases it allows for truly excellent results. A bit of a sore point (but up to a certain point), make sure you have an adequate dissipation system, since this little beast has a tendency to rise quite a bit with the temperatures if put under stress, so accompany it with a nice heat sink and a case well ventilated. âœ… Recommended: if you are looking for a high-level and above all versatile processor, this is for you. There are certainly better performing solutions, but you have to go for i9 (to stay in the Intel field) but the prices are adjusted accordingly.

"IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i7-13700KF Processor 30M Cache, up to 5.40 GHz",not usable out-of-the-box,"On the one hand, Intel delivers a very fast CPU, but it is practically unusable out-of-the-box. The problem is the power consumption is far too high and the associated thermal problems. Even with a 360 AIO water cooler (bequiet Silent Loop 2), the CPU goes to over 100Â°C under load and is then automatically throttled. So in order to achieve a reasonably reasonable noise level, you have to undervolt in the BIOS (turn down the voltage) and limit the maximum power consumption. There are recommendations of 125W on the net, which limits the CPU's performance by around 10-15%. The funny thing is, if you set the power consumption to around 170-180W, you can even achieve more performance (e.g. Cinebench), because the CPU is then no longer throttled due to thermal problems. So if you want to play around in the BIOS and with Intel XTU to have a reasonably acceptable level after hours, you can try the experiment. If you just want to put it together and get started, you're better off buying a 13600 or AMD. Sorry, but that's not how you bring a product to market.",04-Sep-23,2,mklinkel,Germany,negative

But until that switch happened, under less than a minute of CPU usage, it reached to 80Â°c. I mean since these are premium products, there should be some protection layers blocking such usages, and close the programs instead rather than hitting its performance. But anyways, I disabled the integrated device and then it's all smooth. Everything normal except for that one instance explained above. Parallel processing is still shitty though with Windows OS.

I installed a 120mm cooler master lite radiator to control the processor since as incredible as it sounds the 360mm KRAKEN x73 was not able to keep the temperatures at bay. The 120mm Cooler Master keeps the processor without load or minimum load between 32 and 40 degrees and with maximum load and tests it hits 80 degrees, which is simply great considering that the maximum temperature of the Processor is 125 degrees, I placed 2 Noctua Fans at 3000 revolutions on the radiator in push / pull configuration.

This is a genuinely powerful CPU that's been able to handle basically every task that I've thrown at it. It runs demanding tasks like encoding and gaming with ease. Now with that out of the way; Thermals. This thing gets hot, and I mean REALLY hot. If you're going with air cooling I strongly recommend a double tower, six/eight pipe Air cooler like the Corsair A115 or a Cooler Master MA824. If you are going the AIO route, anything LESS than a 360mm AIO will under perform. For that, go with any 360mm AIO from any brand of your choice. If you have the space, go with a 420mm AIO for the best results. Finally, there has been recent reports of CPU degradation and instability when using this CPU. I am using this with an asus ROG STRIX Z790-H motherboard and it basically JUICED the CPU like no tomorrow until I applied intel's Power settings for this CPU. This likely is the cause of the degradation. Be sure to check intel's website for recommended power settings. Also check your motherboard vendor for any bios updates as Intel has confirmed that many motherboard vendors are running the i9 13900k CPU out of intel's specifications. In conclusion here's my personal experience: The CPU functions, but I can not use Asus' AI Overclocking feature as I get a BSOD with the CLOCK_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT error and apps will randomly crash. You probably shouldn't use any AI assisted overclocking feature if you can help it. Even running this at stock, there is still a substantial amount of performance in this CPU. If you have an older rig and are looking to upgrade your CPU, I would just wait for Meteorlake or just go with AMD.

Luckily I had an older i7 that worked on this motherboard.  I dropped it in and it booted, then I did the BIOS update.  After that it boots this CPU just fine. Before this I was a die-hard AMD supporter.  I had 5950x with 16 cores, 32 threads, and 72MB of cache.  But, it just doesn't compete with this i9.  I haven't tried the 7950x, but I read that the P-cores just blow away the AMD cores.  Even with less cache.  The setup of 8 performance cores, and 16 efficiency cores just works.  It stays much cooler than earlier i9's and the AMD.  I use a water cooler, but it's not required.  Nothing slows this down when paired with DDR5. I wish the AMD was better, I like the company more.  But, I want the best of the best, and as of today there is nothing better than this available.  If you game, or do graphics, or anything on your PC this is the CPU for you.  It will NOT disappoint. A word on the X790 chipset.  You would think they will have better performance because they are newer.  They don't.  They will work with the i9 no matter what, while the Z690 might need a BIOS update.  They have one more USB port.  But otherwise there is no benefit to getting Z790 and they cost a LOT more.

Intel supports XMP (extreme memory profile) and this processor is unlocked (it can be overclocked).  Overclocking increases the power consumption and heat; therefore, one needs a robust cooling solution.  Overclocking can void your warranty which is strange since Intel allows and even promotes overclocking with the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility.  I have the NZXT Kraken x 73 RGB liquid cooler.  With the NZXT CAM software you can see the CPU (and GPU) temperatures and control the fan speeds, reducing the risk of damaging the processor.  While idling (at 5.5 GHz) the CPU temperature is 30 C.  Under a 50% load or overclocked the temperatures are below 60 C.  Pros: Good for video editing Cons: A bit pricey for a gaming computer.

Iâ€™m a pretty hardcore gamer and this cpu is the most amazing thing Iâ€™ve ever had when it comes to a high end build. I paired it with a rtx 4080 and needless to say this cpu doesnâ€™t disappoint. Now, this review isnâ€™t about pricing because we all know this cpu is expensive and honestly if youâ€™re only gaming then maybe a 13600k would suffice. However, if you are streaming, photo editing, video editing etcâ€¦. Then this is the right cpu for you. Iâ€™m able to snap together YouTube videos in seconds NOT minutes or anywhere near it. Iâ€™m able to stream and game at the same time with less than a 10 fps loss while gaming and streaming on the highest quality settings. My wife loves it for photo editing bc everything is just perfect. Only downside is that it does run hot but you can get a good 240-360mm aio that will tame this cpu with ease. All the issues I use to have on the 10th gen platform are completely irradiated now that I own this cpu. I did go with the ddr5 and honestly for me it runs better than ddr4. Tech reviewers say otherwise but from personal experience ddr5 is the future NOW. Performance issues I use to have with ddr4 and weaker cpus are just gone now. I can do so much and this cpu doesnâ€™t break a sweat. For instance, ddr4 for whatever reason sometimes wouldnâ€™t work with xmp although it was advertised. I like to tinker so it wasnâ€™t an issue BUT sometimes itâ€™s just nice to do a single click and let it dial itself in and thatâ€™s what ddr5 has done for me. Iâ€™ve used several different sticks with this cpu and from all of them I went with Corsair vengeance. Honestly, this is the most bada$$ cpu Iâ€™ve ever owned or seen in a personal system of mine. If you have the money I couldnâ€™t recommend it enough. Everybody has different needs and in my case I needed this cpu. It hasnâ€™t disappointed. As for amd, if you want the bugs and issues go ahead and grab one of those cpus and tell me how that goes. This cpu can do everything and more.

"IntelCore i9-13900KF Desktop Processor 24 cores (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores) 36M Cache, up to 5.8 GHz' Socket LGA 1700",good . temp issues are overblownw,"i upgraded from 5900xt. I got the msi board z690 -a for 159, and this the 13900kf. I â€˜ve been wanting a cpu with an IGPU for years, but couldnâ€™t justify the price increase on the gpu version. I actually use a dgpu but it really is convenient, and they can be used to accelerate some work. Again, before you judge i'm using this for work, productivity. NOT gaming. I would spend 200 for a gaming cpu. my use case is productivity. iâ€™m a developer, and this is the sole reason i upgraded. I was fighting windows freezing and slowing down during a lot of my workflows. I use wsl intellj, docker, react apps java etc, often at the same time. Itâ€™s pretty noticeable the improvement. It really helped.  Like that i could use ddr4 for now since the boards are about 150 it was acceptable. Heat: The cpu gets a bad reputation due to heat and wattage. I put this in the bucket frankly that amd got as well. I mean itâ€™s fine they are using as much power as needed to maximize perf. I limited the cpu to 250w, and it runs on a d15 cooler than my 5900, Full load can get up to high 80c, but working is 30â€™s. you lose very little perf by running it more in the zone. I don't know about other boards but that msi one sure makes it easy and the price if right. About the cpu: it has a ton of cores, I didn't need to buy ddr5--  i need quite a lot of ram and it still costs too much for the benefit it provides in my workload. The memory controller on 13gen is far better than ryzen 5000 series. I couldn't before get my ddr4 stable at 4000 on the 5900x and it did it on the intel one immediately. Indeed i was even able to tighten up the timings just a touch. So modern processors (and i'd assume the amd ones as well) have made welcome improvements to memory support. Id' say if you don't need as much ram say 32gb, and you don't have ddr4 already to tide you over i'd consider getting ddr5 though.  I mean nothing is cheaper than what you have and 4k speed is fine. If i had nothing or maybe some old ram i'd go w/ ddr5. Price: For 570 itâ€™s decent deal here. It is more than i love spending, but for what you get it is a lot better than what amd is offering at the time i write this which was 700. I do wish intel supported board reuse down the line, but that even can. be overblown (to an extent, and only an extent) though it's a selling feature to me frankly reuse!! I had to really think about that. I don't understand why intel is so stubborn on this subject.  with my amd cpu i went from 2700x to 5900x and the board went from a 470 to 570 because i waned more io and better pcie but i also gave that board to my kid and upgraded it one time. With intel especially I mean i just buy cheap boards anyway and upgrade more because there are a ton of features that get added half the time. I usually try to spend about 150 on a board, though it. is getting harder but it would be more my preference. I 'm not really onboard with the 600 motherboards. Is there a  300 one in-between i guess so but that's equally unappealing to me esp w/ out the upgrade. Tips/A rant if you will: trust me on this that msi board for 159 is so amazing. It really works great. donâ€™t worry about the vrm. thatâ€™s also very overblown too. you can go calculate the amperage this will not come close. ALso msi is a great brand and the bios is easy to navigate. If you want fancy audio buy a dac that you can reuse and plug into usb and keep reusing it. Just think about what you really need in there. The msi board has a nice selection of pcie slots and well placed nvme. I use multiple gpu one nvidia gpu quatro for encoding (its a small one) and and amd one 6900 i bought for 570 for gaming. I just really love the layout connectivity and features of the board. They cut all the stuff i don't need and pared with the cpu it's all together about 700 for a cpu and board, pretty much as good as you can get.",16-Nov-22,5,s,the United States,positive

Minimal overclocking headroom as Intel has already milked 90% of the performance on stock settings. However, with some tweaking, you're likely to get up to 6.2 Ghz boost behavior for single-core loads, and bump up the all-core boost to 5.7 Ghz (up from 5.5 Ghz stock). With some further tweaking of the voltage-frequency curve, you could probably tweak this even further. I'm not a big fan of all-core overclocks on these type of processors, as you will lose the boosting single-core speed. In my opinion, this processor shines for gaming because of its single-core boosting performance. Memory controller has been significantly improved over Alder Lake. I was easily able to get my DDR5 6400 XMP profile running without any tweaking. I'm pretty sure this can be easily pushed further, but it seems like around 6400 Mhz memory is the roughly the sweet spot in terms of price vs performance. Very power hungry, but despite the bad reputation from reviewers, the power consumption can be easily tamed. If you run power limits unlocked, you will likely be thermal limited due to thermal throttling at 100c. However, you don't need unlocked power limits - you're talking about a very small 5-10% performance uplift but using >100W more power to achieve this. I would suggest running it at stock power limits, or unlocked power limits but seriously consider undervolting. On a final note, I wouldn't consider getting the rumored 6.0 Ghz version of the 13900K in the future. The current 13900K can easily be pushed to >6 Ghz boost speeds and will save you money.",22-Nov-22,5,Nick B,the United States,positive

Once I discovered that I had to slow the memory down from the 6600MHz XMP rating to 6200MHz, the board/cpu combo has worked very reliably  (multiple passes of OCCT Gold stress test).  Just checking the XMP II box,  the 6200MHz box and the (so called) AI overclocking box in the bios gives a score of 40K on Cinebench R23 so it's plenty fast -- the loss of 400MHz memory bandwidth isn't a big deal.  I tried various other adjustments but the latter turned out to be sufficiently fast and very reliable.  My current chip has a Silicon Predictor(SP) of 99 (roll of the dice).  I suspect that higher SP levels while possible are rare. I am using a ARCTIC Liquid Freezer II 360  AIO which works OK but the CPU can run hot.  The mother board cooling prediction for said AIO is 155 but that is not really enough for this chip to run all out.  It is easy to get this CPU up to 100C using OCT Power Stress test.  While the CPU might run at 100C for a long time, it will not do it any good and it will not run reliably -- I needed to check the 90C max box in the bios to get it to pass the OCCT power stress test.  I have a RTX 4090 and in the OCCT power test the net system power gets up to 1100W.  Normal gaming so far never gets to such power levels but still worth considering. FWIW, I have had a CPU apparently fail from running the OCCT Power Stress test.  If you want to run this CPU all out with reasonable temps, you really need significant cooling.  I doubt any AIO will work for this.  I suggest an open loop system with something like a Watercool MO-RA3 420 PRO radiator. All said, If you are building a gaming system, you would be just as well served with a ASUS ROG Strix Z690-E and a i9-12900KF CPU.  It will be easier to cool and will save you some money for a better graphics card which will make *much* more difference in most games than the CPU.",21-Jun-23,4,elviscera,the United States,positive

Too warm, really. UPS says the computer is using 575 watts during the CPU stress test, about 175 watts at idle. TPU is 253w ... so with the 80%+ PS inefficiency, 300w makes sense. When using the 3080 GPU with the i9 CPU ... well, the heat coming from the case is similar to a 1000w space heater, really. Now reconsidering my choice for only an 850w PS. 1000w would probably be a better idea for this beast. As for speed. That's relative. But I am coming from an i9-7900x, and this is 3x faster, and it feels 3x faster. Memory is slower, (4ch vs 2ch) -- so I had to use DDR5-6400 to get a similar memory bandwidth. Lost some latency, but the overall effect is the thing still seems plenty fast. I dislike the way the CPU case instantly jumps to 100c -- no thermal mass what-so-ever in the CPU case. Or I have a bad CPU without whatever filler Intel puts between the die and the case. In any case, Intel needs to allow for more thermal mass to reduce these thermal stresses of instantaneous temp changes.

So I don't know if the problem is with the processor or if I have a board compatibility issue, but I think I should not have had a board compatibility issue, and I have a 900 W power supply so there's no reason why there wasn't enough power to boot, I also used a liquid cooler so it should have had zero heat problems.

The TLDR; It's lightening quick, and It's super easy to install. As with all CPU's care should be taken when installing and handling the CPU, but other than that it's relatively straight forward. All I have to say, is this CPU is a beast. Like its so overkill for the average user. In for gaming it is just overkill. It is the perfect CPU for me, but also for those who do intensive work loads, such as running running large data models for AI purposes. My particular use case for this CPU was to allow me to build a virtual lab to which I could analyse malware in an virtual sandbox, whilst also emulating real world hacking attacks. At present I am able to run several virtual machines with no performance issues. As you can probably imagine, this power hungry beast can get warm, but with an adequate cooling solution, there should be no issues in keeping the PC nice and cool.  I have paired this CPU with an AIO, and also additional fans for the case to ensure there is a lot of air flow to ensure that the thermals are a good temperature. My advice to anybody purchasing this CPU - go for it - it's well worth the investment, while at the same time you'll be future proofing your soon to be BEAST of a machine for the next 10 years.",01-Sep-23,5,Scott Atkinson,the United Kingdom,positive

"Intel Core I9-13900K Processor 36M Cache, Up to 5.80 Ghz, LGA 1700",Working perfectly,"CPU working just as it should be. People's main concern with this product is obviously the temps. To reassure people, and from a VFX artist's perspective, my temperatures are respectable. I have the Corsair H170I ELITE CAPELLIX 420 mm AIO attached to it. When running tasks like having Opera open with even 30 tabs, Spotify, file browser and settings all open at the same time, my temps max at 34 degrees Celsius. When I'm in Unreal engine it never goes above 45 (but yes it is mainly GPU real-time rendering). it will use around 10 % of the CPU still however. in Cinema 4d viewport it will never go above 34c, when rendering a 4k 3d scene it ranges from 70-86 degrees Celsius max. whatever software I'm using whether it's Adobe software, c4d, unreal, Houdini, Davinci, it will never hit over 90c. Installation was absolutely fine and considering this was the first ever system I've built, so it demonstrates how easy it was to put into the motherboard if you just follow instructions to a tee. The H170I also comes with pre-applied thermal paste so I didn't even have to worry about that which was a bonus. and it's obviously doing its job at transferring all that heat.

"Intel Core I9-13900K Processor 36M Cache, Up to 5.80 Ghz, LGA 1700",A monster with a big appetite!,"I knew what I was getting myself into. The 13900K is an absolute monster. Not just in terms of performance, but also in terms of power consumption and waste heat. I'll keep it short: Absolutely top for video work and rendering! Tons of computing power for software encoding and rendering. The Intel Quicksync encoder can render h.265 videos in 4K more than 3 times(!) faster than my 1080ti that I've used for this so far (with a 7700K that delivered about 80-90% of the performance of the 1080ti). There's nothing more to say about gaming. In current games, my 1080ti is constantly at its limit and the CPU gets bored, where the 7700K would otherwise have slowed everything down. Otherwise, there are enough reviews that show how much power is packed into this small piece of pressed technology. Now for the important points which I am not really criticising but just want to draw attention to: Yes, the power consumption and the waste heat are in a whole new league. Most gaming motherboards blast the CPU with voltage to ensure that everything is stable. But this processor cannot be cooled with that, no matter how good the CPU cooler is. It will ALWAYS reach 100Â°C due to the limit of the heat spreader. I use an Arctic Freezer II 280mm. I did three things to bring the temperatures under control: 1. Bought the Thermalright Contact Frame. I first used the original Intel mount and that immediately pushed me to the thermal limit. With the Contact Frame I immediately reduced the temperatures by 4-8Â°C per core and went from permanent thermal throttling to occasional hiccups in the temp throttle with Cinebench R23. 2. Undervolting. On the Asus Prime Z790-A I slowly lowered the core voltage using an offset while Cinebench was running. XMPII is activated. First in 0.02V steps until the blue screen and then I worked my way up. I was then stable in Cinebench at -0.135V, then later had a BSOD while gaming and now it is absolutely stable at -0.13V. CPU package power in Cinebench reduced from 310W peak power and 295W average to 270W peak power and 260W average in Cinebench. That brought the CPU down 10Â°C in the Cinebench 10min test. 3. Liquid Metal. Not really necessary but I wanted to get rid of a few more degrees to have enough reserves for the summer. Reduced the temperature by another 4-6Â°C. After these adjustments, I now have ALL cores in permanent turbo boost at 5.5GHz+4.3GHz, without throttling at 80Â°C peak single run Cinebench R23 and under 90Â°C in the endurance test with a fan curve tuned to quiet. WARNING: With these settings, the CPU is not stable in Prime95 and will crash the system! The loadline calibration must be set to level 5, but this will then bring the old power levels back. Undervolting is not suitable for every application. You then have to live with the 100Â°C limits if you don't want to use direct die cooling.",02-Apr-23,5,Marc Hoffmann,Germany,negative

"Intel Core I9-13900K Processor 36M Cache, Up to 5.80 Ghz, LGA 1700","Good, but...","The best processor in 2022-2023 for those who want to both game and work. Unfortunately, even with undervolting as efficiency it is a disaster, in gaming it consumes 3-4 times more than it should. When I watch a film every now and then the frequency jumps to the maximum, consuming 25-30 watts in Idle or almost, meh. I had to struggle to make custom energy profiles with QuickCPU to have acceptable consumption, but they are still inconvenient to change for each game and application, even with PowerPlanSwitcher. Windows is also to blame as it doesn't help, because it doesn't scale the frequency based on consumption. Then I also noticed that windows prefers to use the HT of the P-cores rather than the e-cores, increasing inefficiency and thus also causing performance drops since the logical cores are much less powerful than the efficient cores. As for overclocking there is nothing to do, the maximum to stay in PL2 and TMax 90Â° in full is 5.8Ghz on 2-3 cores, 5.7GHz on 7 cores and 5.5GHz on all P-cores, however setting it like this it becomes more inefficient with processes that require fewer cores. I've noticed that the CPU has a sweet spot at 5.3GHz where performance, efficiency and temperatures are much better, so one of the power plans I did with QuickCPU limits the clock to that frequency. The most positive thing is that compared to AMD it is possible to overclock the memory and increase performance by 10-15% in apps and games that use a lot of it and by doing so the CPU becomes more efficient given that the memories consume few watts and speed up computational performance and the difference with AMD's 3D VCache is bridged precisely in the applications in which it has the upper hand. To get this result I overclocked them to 6667 CL32 with the VDD safe at 1.435v and I lowered the secondary and tertiary timings, be careful that if you don't overclock properly you might not get any benefits, it's very stuff for geeks , between 4800 CL40 stock and 7200 CL34 stock will only change by 5%. As a test game at the end of the overclock I used Rust which is among the games that benefit most from fast RAM and cache and the difference is impressive, I went from 115 FPS with the stock XMP 5200 profile to 135 FPS with 6667 CL32. Probably with a high-end motherboard and RAM with dies that reach 8600MHz you can do better, but the important thing is the best compromise between frequency and timings. Don't get the F version because it's useless, it makes no sense to exist, the integrated GPU is worth â‚¬50, you pay almost nothing for it and when you need it it's always there ready, I connected the second monitor and Intel's Quick Sync to record and Processing videos is good, it consumes very little 1-10watts, it doesn't affect temperatures, you can deactivate it whenever you want and it is extremely useful even in the event of a failure of the dedicated one.",02-Nov-23,4,Roenin,Italy,negative

Actually two. because first you pay the processor its weight in gold, and probably for office or gaming use all this excess power is not necessary at all. And because during the life of the processor... you will pay dearly for the electricity bill... this little beast at full load consumes a minimum of 253 Watts (according to Intel specifications), but if your motherboard needs overclocking or it feels sbrex. .. it will also consume 300W .. as long as the heatsink keeps the processor below 100Â°C. Furthermore... you will need a heatsink with counter-flakes to dissipate 250-300 Watts of energy... and a normal 360 liquid AIO with 3 120 fans is not enough... it must be a heatsink with extra features to be able to keep below 100Â° the CPU is under stress and therefore do not let it go into thermal throttling. Probably a 13th generation i5 or i7 are more suitable for most users, and consume less power. as well as costing less. Also... if you plan to use a video card you might prefer the i9 13900f version, which does not include a GPU integrated into the processor. Why? Because many motherboards automatically disable the integrated IGPU if you have a real video card in your computer. so it would be money spent unnecessarily.

"IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i9-13900KF Processor 36M Cache, up to 5.80 GHz",IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i9-13900KF: Reliable Performance with Adequate Cooling,"The IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i9-13900KF processor is a real powerhouse in terms of performance, but requires an adequate cooling system to get the most out of its potential. With 24 cores (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores) and a 36MB cache, this processor is designed to handle intense workloads and extreme multitasking. One of the main features of this processor is its reliability. Intel is renowned for the quality and reliability of its products, and the Coreâ„¢ i9-13900KF is no exception. However, it is important to note that given its high performance, it generates considerable heat during use. To optimize performance and ensure stable operation over time, I highly recommend pairing the processor with a good thermal paste, such as THERMAL GRIZZLY TG-KE-002-R, and a high-quality heat sink, such as DeepCool LT720 360 mm 4th Gen. These components will ensure effective heat dissipation and keep the CPU temperature under control even during the most intense usage sessions.

IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i5-14600KF New Gaming Desktop Processor 14 cores (6 P-cores + 8 E-cores) - Unlocked,Running air cooled on DeepCool Assassin IV with ease,"So far so good.  This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS. In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games **Update** I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power. If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on. The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.  Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.  My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC. Core wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen.",03-Nov-23,5,Amazon lover,the United States,future expectation

Even though it's a very expensive precision device, the sloppy packaging is still a real turn-off. I really don't recommend buying precision devices like this on Amazon. When I bought the MB it came in a big paper bag. When I bought the memory it came in a paper bag. Of course the M.2 too. I bought it on Amazon because it was convenient, but I need to change my mind. If you have no choice but to buy it on Amazon, choose products that are sold directly by the manufacturer or shipped directly from the store. The user review is the 14geni7, which is the only one with improved performance from the 13gen. I use it with a 4070ti and it's comfortable for both work and games. I heard that the 14gen is the last i series, so I bought it. I'm going to install a GPU anyway, so I chose the F. I bought it on sale for about 10,000 yen cheaper and it's still cheaper than the K, so it's definitely a good deal. It's better to get it cheaper, so I strongly recommend allocating that budget to the GPU. It's helpful to have a graphics function when the GPU breaks down, but in my case, when the GPU broke down in the past, there was only so much the CPU could do, so I ended up not using the PC until I bought a new GPU. Making use of that experience, I have now purchased a spare GPU of around mid-range specs. The downside of having an F is that without a GPU, the BIOS, let alone the screen, won't turn on, so if you're building a new one or trying to build one for the first time, you need to think about the order in which you buy them to check the operation, so be careful about that.

However, if you're a tinkerer at heart, eager to dive deeper than the surface-level information often presented in YouTube ""videos"" (or should we say, commercials), this is unquestionably for you. I've acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailersâ€”Best Buy, Newegg, and others included. For those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fansâ€” Avoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans. Genuine static pressure fans, capable of efficiently doing the job, are what you need. Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics. When selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options. If a high-binned QVL compatible set isn't your choice, at a minimum, go for HYNIX A for single rank and HYNIX M for dual rank. The 14900K, when expertly tuned, becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouseâ€”achieving 43 to 44k in R23, with 6.2GHz boosting, 5.9GHz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads, and 16 physical e-cores at 4.7GHz for a total of 32 threads, of which only 8 are virtual. With hyper-threading and e-cores enabled, it supports 8200 to 8400 MTS CL38 DDR5 RAM, boasts sub-55ns bus latency, and sub-9.3ns FWL. It's a marvel in Aida64 full, minus SSD, burn-in stress test stability. Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns... Did I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40Â°C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50Â°C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I'd advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methodsâ€”increased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU. For tinkerers, this CPU is a dream come true. As of this dateâ€”4-4-2024: We anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve, but that's a discussion for another time. The X3D Elephant in the room: Don't worry, I own one, and this is about science, not purchase bias... We'll sidestep intricate discussions about CLDO, FCLK, and MCLK concerns, and why the substantial L3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet-based IMC in handling DDR5 for gamers. If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn't primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn't allow for it since it's not monolithic, which wouldn't be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn't fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults."" Indeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there's no cause for concern. Let's briefly touch on the ""benefits"" like reduced thermals and supposed platform longevity (as if motherboard chipset upgrades and advancements in power delivery methods don't occur... humor me, over the planned 6 years). I, too, long for Z390 features on my Z790 board (/end sarcasm), not to mention the potential for longer boot times when tinkering with DDR5 or PBO, or even under normal conditions, and texture stutter/tearing... oops, and all those other delightful topics Lisa tends to highlight without addressing the influence of influencers with communications degrees rather than computer science degrees.  Just having fun, do what you love! I don't blame Amazon, Intel, AMD, or Nvidia more than the other. Manufacturing and shipping issues happen. The chip I received from Amazon didn't meet my expectations, but my other purchases have been exceptional. By chance alone, the other four 14900Ks I've received from various distributors have been stellar! Note: Settings in pictures are daily driven....No stability concerns all AIDIA 64 Stress tested for multiple hours and hundreds of gaming/workload hours.

It can get pretty hot and there are only a small handful of air coolers that can handle this 14900k without setting power limits (which most people don't know how to do, let alone even know what that means) If you're not doing a custom water loop to cool your 14900k, I recommend you do what I've done to cool mine, you dont neeeed to, but it helps. I have an AIO (All-In-One Cooler) and I setup a push-pull configuration on my radiator. That means I have 3 fans on the bottom blowing in through the radiator, and 3 more fans blowing up and out of the case. Both are blowing upward. It creates more airflow. One side is pushing the air, the other side is helping pull that air through. Then I got a thermalright contact frame. Any LGA 1700 contact frame should work but the thermalright version is cheap. It might say 12th/13th Gen but it will also work on 14th Gen. So get an AIO, setup a push-pull fan configuration and get a contact frame. It's helping my Temps significantly. I typically stay in the high 50's or low 60's during 4K gaming. This CPU draws a ton of power so you might see it bump up to 80â° occasionally, for a very brief moment.

IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i5-14600KF New Gaming Desktop Processor 14 cores (6 P-cores + 8 E-cores) - Unlocked,"Fast, but unstable when overclocked.","I built 3 systems using 14900 series. They all had serious stability problems when in use.  After researching for weeks and reinstalling OS with no better result.  I finally disabled overclocking ""AI overclocking"", which was running as high as 1.6v.  I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE.  this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully.  It basically throttles the chip. I can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out.  Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all ""tests"" showed it was fine.  I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive.  It does run HOT even with water cooling.  IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5.  Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips. Here's the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use.  Adobe CS uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync iGPU simultaneously which rarely went above 40%, and usually was around 15-20 when editing.  HW encodes for HD were at 350fps, software, 250, intel 300.  So a small advantage in Adobe CS is why I went with the 14900K vs KF. System was using ""AI overclocking"" pushing it to 6.2 roughly single core.  Disabled in BIOS now. Specs: Asus z290a Wifi II, Corsair 96GB DDR5 5600, Samsung 990 Pro, CPU Water cooled, 3080ti So the ""K"" is basically useless for me at this point and don't see myself doing it manually as it's just not worth it to me.

IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i5-14600KF New Gaming Desktop Processor 14 cores (6 P-cores + 8 E-cores) - Unlocked,IF YOU WANT THE AIR COOLED OPTION,"I'm not going to go over the same performance reviews others have done, yes its very fast for only $550 its the king of the poor mans build PC. my last PC its replacing was a $1000 10980xe and looking at the numbers the 14900k in average is 70-77% faster than the 10980xe. the only disadvantage between the 2 was the 10980xe had 48 PCIe lanes and ran 32c to 56c hot. i can't say the same about the 14900k heat, its spreader is almost half of the 10980xe. you can't just simply add a stock cooler or a ""MC'watercooler"" and expect the problem will solve itself. this is the first CPU in my 26 yrs of building PC's you have to plan out your cooler set up. ever since a 2012 water leak from these Mc'watercoolers (all in one 2 fan radiator kits sold by name brands) Ive never trusted them cost me $1500 in damages. The only water coolers that don't leak for me were the ones i built but water cooling is expensive and you have to inspect them at least every 3 months for debris in the tank or leaks. with air i only have to clean the pc 2x a year. yes you can control temps with an air cooler, and get the same temps as a 3 fan radiator water cooler. I'll post the results without adding a watt limit in the mobo post screen. here is the parts i bought to air cool running the new cinabench 2024 for 30 mins i can get max performance on a defualt non OC not hitting above 99C on the P cores 1. Noctua NH-D15 chromax.Black | Dual-Tower CPU Cooler | 140mm | Black 2. Noctua NF-A15 HS-PWM chromax.Black.swap (this adds a 3rd fan for the air cooler you'll need it) 3. FDXGYH 4 Pcs CPU Heatsink Fan Buckle PC Mainboard CPU Radiator Fan 12CM Wire Buckle Upper Hook Type Fixing Clip  (these buckles are compatible with noctus 140mm fans) 4. Easycargo 40mm Heatsink Kit 40mmx40mmx20mm (this you place on the flat base of the noctua cooler will help dissipate heat) 5. Easycargo 100pcs Heatsink Assortment Kit Small Cooler Aluminum Heat (these you throw on the back of your mobo on and around the mount brackets you'll me amazed how adding heat sinks on the back of the mobo will reduce temps) 6. Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut (this is the best thermal grease cooler by 1-2c cooler than artic silver mx 6) 7. Thermalright Intel 12th/13th Generation LGA1700 Anti-Bending Buckle ( a must add a little thermal grease on the cpu side flaps this buckle is 100% aluminum will al help dissipate heat. then i went to my mother board software options (mobo is an MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX) select ""CPU cooler tuning"" select ""tower air cooling"" which will limit the wattage draw to under 300w also note if you are not using a Water Cooling Reservoir  you should also use this option, water cooling a 14900k and OC really does require a reservoir, and a 4x 120 fan size radiator if you're simply using a pre-built 2x fan radiator its not enough to handle the 14900k and the CPU is known for drawing 370w plus!! so using air cooled i got a 2371 score with no watt limiter option an temps were 78-100c on the p cores, and with the 300 watt limit the score was  2328 with temps 70-99c never hit 100c case the limiter would kick in. (note this is from CPU testing that punishes the CPU realistically i don't see this CPU going over 88c even on the most demanding game in 3 years. i personally do not recommend OC this CPU its already been pushed to its limits by INTEL at best for another 100 watts when all you're getting is 3-4 more FPS and that's not worth it. and all these people bragging a 6.2-6.5ghz OC, there just flexing for clout, then they take the CPU back to default. i already have my P cores spiking to 6.002 at 288-300 watts, and under 99c temps; adding 0.198mhz will meaning nothing for apps and gaming. personal note the MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX Gaming Motherboard is absolutely amazing at squeezing out all the performance of the 14900k worth the $700 price never crashed during testing that 26 power phases is godly  compared to my last gen EVGA x299 dark had 12 phase...RIP EGA :(",11-Feb-24,5,JZ the reviewer,the United States,positive

If you put too much voltage you are going to damage it. I want to delid it but I don't see the need and here is why Even if I can get it 20 degrees cooler it will not matter It will still need 3.5 to 4.2 volts to stay stable at advertised speeds. I am running it @ 5.4 GHZ all P cores and this thing is unbelievably reliable . And maybe 10 seconds extra to render vs 5.7 to 6.0 GHZ I get the point that ppl want to have the Bragging rights to say that it runs that fast but it will gwt damaged guaranteed 400 watts is a lot for that little unit. I think that 5.4 5.3 5.2 is more than enough specially when you have a total of 32 threads and gaming is practically single threaded . And most games are GPU bound. I only use it in the gaming department for Flight simulator and have not seen it above 68 degrees. I had a 4770 k and still running strong at 4.5 GHZ in a very small case. Intel is a beast and this I 9 is very good . Future proof for at least 5 years to come . Note. I have delided at least 20 cpus and the ones that got damaged were the ones that got a lot of voltage .

IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i5-14600KF New Gaming Desktop Processor 14 cores (6 P-cores + 8 E-cores) - Unlocked,Much faster than my previous i7-6850k,"So I finally upgraded my home workstation, and went to this new i9-14900K. It is incredibly fast. I had a Davinci Resolve video project file that I rendered on my old setup, the i7-6850K and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render. On the new i9, the exact same file was re exported, took just over 8 minutes..! almost a 3x speed increase.! Also, when you speed up footage in Resolve, the old cpu could not play it back smoothly, it would jump and chug like crazy, the new i9, it plays it back sped up 800% no problems and I can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly. Applications open u p much faster too, but that could be more due to the pcie4.0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme I had in the old build. The one thing I do not like about the new cpu, is the number of pci lanes. You only get 20, 16 are pcie5.0 and 4 are pcie4.0. This wont be an issue for most people, but my old cpu had 40 lanes, allowing me to run 3 GPU's at the same time, and YES, I needed them, I use GPU rendering software that can use up to 8 GPU's in one system on one license and every additional GPU speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3D sims. With this new cpu, I can only run 2 GPU's and they run at 8x, cause they share the 16x, and that does leave me 4 full pcie4.0 lanes for the system drive. It is not a deal breaker, and the increased speed overall is well worth it. One thing EVERYBODY should be aware of, is these new intel chips have P cores and E cores. Something my old cpu did NOT have. E-cores can severely impact certain software performance. When I booted up the new machine and tried my Ableton DAW  for the first time, I was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost, and the software was literally almost unusable.! The E-cores were slowing the software down so bad, I could barely change settings in the preferences.! It was that bad. I had to install process lasso ( fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it ) and disable the use of E-cores for Ableton and then it worked very fast and is great.!",19-Mar-24,5,Eric E.,the United States,negative

It's OK but I can't rave over it.  It is more of an sideways change rather than an upgrade. The i9-14900K is fast but not more so that a i9-13900K.  For me, the Cinebench R23 scores are about the same for 13th versus 14th gen.  Though the i9-14900K appears to run DDR5 more stably and at higher frequencies than the i9-13900K.  Also, the i9-14900K is enabled for XTU AI enable tuning in XTU but it's not that helpful.  I even wonder if it is worth getting a K at all, these CPU's are plenty fast for gaming without overclocking. I did NOT notice a significant improvement in the operating temperatures.  Maybe a slight improvement but I did flush out the cooling system and clean out the water block so I am doubtful that the running temps are better.  Also, I suggest that you NOT let these chips get anywhere near TjMax (100C).  I had one i9-13900KF literally fail due to allowing it to get to TjMax frequently when stress testing.  A second one became slightly flaky. I thought the built in ARC display support of the K version might be helpful since I intended to devote the graphics card to the gaming monitor and use the built-in ARC on a side display.  But as it turns out, it wasn't worth it for me.  If you are gaming with this level of processor, you really need a comparable graphics card but most of them will drive four displays.  IMO, you are better off getting a KF and spending the money so saved on better graphics card. The original asking price was insane, I bought it on a whim on a late night.

He bought a z790 board and was amazed how far ahead the 13900k is in comparison an overclocked Skylake-X processor. He fixed the issue with the x299 system, but he decided to stay with Raptor Lake. All of which is okay by me because that old 13900k had no overclocking headroom, and I could only undervolt it by 5mv before it became unstable. I was going to buy another 13900k or maybe the ks version, but I decided to wait for the 14900k. The 14900k I got on the other hand has some overclocking headroom. I already set all P-cores to 5.8GHz, while keeping the double-core Turbo Boost at 6.0GHz. I also set the cache to 5.2Ghz and it's completely stable. I was not able to raise the multiplier at all with my 13900k. Just happy my 14900k isn't a lottery loser. While the clock of both the 13900ks and 14900k are the same, the 13900ks has a cherry picked memory controller. If you're looking to do a ton of RAM overclocking then the 13900ks may be the way to go.... but that's not to say if you'd get a 14900k with a good memory controller. Both my 13900k and 14900k work with DDR5-7200 RAM with XMP set, and no adjustments to the memory controller voltages.

Coming from an i7-8700k, the performance boost is nothing short of incredible. Multitasking, gaming, and content creation have all seen a significant improvement. Multithreaded applications and gaming experiences run smoother.  It's a productivity powerhouse. The clock speeds are no slouch either, making it excellent for single-threaded tasks and gaming. The major downside of this CPU is the heat it generates. Even with a high-end cooling solution, it tends to run hot, and that's something you must take into consideration when setting up your cooling solution. Be ready for this CPU to draw a significant amount of power at full load. It can put quite a load on your power supply and might necessitate an upgrade if you're not already prepared. The Intel i9-14900k is an incredible processor, and the upgrade from an i7-8700k is substantial. Its exceptional performance in various tasks justifies its price tag.

I decided it was time..well, actually I got the itch. I decided to go with the 14700K for a few reasons. One is that it's the only 14th gen part from Intel that got a significant upgrade (four more e-cores and 8 more threads, plus a small clock boost). I also don't like that the 3DFX part from AMD had caused some minor issues for people, and I definitely don't like the RAM issues I see all the time on AMD systems. If it wasn't for the RAM issues, I may have gone AMD this time. Out of all the Intel systems I have assembled for customers over the years, I have not once come across a RAM issue that wasn't caused by bad RAM. This CPU is working perfectly, and gaming excellently. Gaming benchmarks show it to be a very good CPU, and I am not having any issues with it. If you are interested in any other Intel parts, I suggest going with 13th gen as you will basically get the same part for less money. For an i7 system though, this is an excellent CPU and a half decent upgrade over the previous gen.",08-Dec-23,5,Mergatroid,Canada,positive
Intel Core I7-14700K LGA 771 New Gaming Desktop Processor 20 Cores (8 P-Cores + 12 E-Cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked,Switching from 7700k,"Since the 7700k is not compatible with Windows 11, I thought it was time to build a new PC, so I chose this one. I've been using an i7 with a K until now, so I did the same this time. The 7700k consumes 91W of power, but this one consumes 253W, which was eye-opening. The 7700k was cooled sufficiently with the Kotetsu, but this one didn't seem to be able to do that, so I chose the DeepCool AK620 cooler. If I limit the power to 125W, it will settle at about 70 degrees, so I think I can use it with confidence. I think it will go down a little more if I apply the grease properly. As for the important thing, there are 28 cores including the logical core, so I can feel secure that it won't get heavy even if I do a lot of work. Considering my usage, it is over-specified, but I prefer to buy a high-performance one and feel secure that I bought something that is sufficient, rather than regretting later that the performance is not enough. This sense of security is the reason why I continue to buy i7. The need for power limiting is also an advantage for me. If I normally keep the limit at 125W, it gives me the peace of mind of knowing I can lift the limit in an emergency (I know that such an emergency will never come).

Intel Core I7-14700K LGA 771 New Gaming Desktop Processor 20 Cores (8 P-Cores + 12 E-Cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked,i7-14700K is a significant improvement from i9-12900K,"I decided the difference between the i7 and the i9 didn't justify the price difference, considering I was already getting about 1/3 more performance than my 12th generation i9. I wanted plenty of motherboard resources so I also bought the MSI MEG Z790 ACE, 32 GB of Kingston Fury 6400MT/s DDR5 and a 2TB Samsung 990 NVMe drive. Cooling had been a slight issue with the 12th generation i9, even with a 360mm AIO cooler, so I went custom loop. Along the way I found a GPU water cooler on sale and decided to install a lot of cooling. The Thermaltake 900 tower can take two 560mm radiators, but I wanted some disks, so I went for a 560x140 and a 280x140, both 45mm thick and backed by 6 fans. Four more fans feed air into the case and there's till plenty of clear space for more air to be dragged in. So what's the result? The processor runs at 85C worst case, and only two cores at that temperature. The fast DDR5 does make a significant difference. I initially ran it at 6GT/s then turned it up to 6.2 and finally 6.4. The last change is a 3.5% change in DDR5 speed and that gave me a 2.4% increase in system speed. I kept my old RTX3070 which used to run over 80C and now runs at 62C worst case. So despite more performance the system runs a lot cooler. I mostly run X-Plane 12, which runs the GPU and CPU very hard, continuously. After several hours the cooling water reached 36C and the worst core temperature was 85C. The processor just works. No stability issues with the standard settings on the MSI Z690 motherboard. There are three standard memory tuning options for 6.0, 6.2, and 6.4 GT/s and all work. This will do for me for a few years.",31-May-24,5,Chris H,the United States,positive

I wouldn't consider building new with it however. There's a cost to this CPU though. Heat. And power draw. I have an Arctic Liquid Freezer III 360 AIO on this chip, and even with a sizable undervolt, it still throttles at around 230W running 100C. It feels like this chip is almost uncoolable.

User benchmark puts 14700k as only being 47% faster than the 8700k, despite being 8 years and 6 generations apart. The main improvement from my point of view is the reduced idle/casual power use. My UPS tells me that for my 8700k/1070ti system I drew ~0.43 Kw, and my new 14700k/4070ti super draws ~0.31 Kw watching YT, browsing the web (includes fans, monitors, etc).

I upgraded from a 12700k, and saw only minor improvements, and at the expense of power cost. My desktop now idles at 150-250 watts... before with my 12700k it was idling at like half that. in most cases a lot of people wont care, however being forced to live in a high cost of living state like CA, where electricity is $0.44 per kwh, that means just idling is costing me 0.11 per hour, that's $1000 a year just in idling... plus all the electricity my house uses. I'm only here temporarily (military) and will be moving as soon as retire, but its something to note. On top of that, its a straight refresh of the older 13th gen, and they blocked APO for the 13th and 12th gen and aren't working on getting it working across the board (only minor useless titles no one honestly cares about)... If it was a bit cheaper to go AMD, I would have went to a 7800x3d, but that would have cost me about 900 just to switch, due to having to buy new RAM (still on DDR4, 3600mhz/CL14) and Motherboard...

Bios updates to the motherboard did not help the issue.  Putting in a known good CPU allowed the final test of the motherboard and original system RAM and that all passed which indicates a issue with the CPU.

Intel Core I7-14700Kf LGA 1700 New Gaming Desktop Processor 20 Cores (8 P-Cores + 12 E-Cores) - Unlocked,The shipping method is still terrible.,"It arrived in a paper bag. Even though it's a very expensive precision device, the sloppy packaging is still a real turn-off. I really don't recommend buying precision devices like this on Amazon. When I bought the MB it came in a big paper bag. When I bought the memory it came in a paper bag. Of course the M.2 too. I bought it on Amazon because it was convenient, but I need to change my mind. If you have no choice but to buy it on Amazon, choose products that are sold directly by the manufacturer or shipped directly from the store. The user review is the 14geni7, which is the only one with improved performance from the 13gen. I use it with a 4070ti and it's comfortable for both work and games. I heard that the 14gen is the last i series, so I bought it. I'm going to install a GPU anyway, so I chose the F. I bought it on sale for about 10,000 yen cheaper and it's still cheaper than the K, so it's definitely a good deal. It's better to get it cheaper, so I strongly recommend allocating that budget to the GPU. It's helpful to have a graphics function when the GPU breaks down, but in my case, when the GPU broke down in the past, there was only so much the CPU could do, so I ended up not using the PC until I bought a new GPU. Making use of that experience, I have now purchased a spare GPU of around mid-range specs. The downside of having an F is that without a GPU, the BIOS, let alone the screen, won't turn on, so if you're building a new one or trying to build one for the first time, you need to think about the order in which you buy them to check the operation, so be careful about that.

Intel Core I7-14700Kf LGA 1700 New Gaming Desktop Processor 20 Cores (8 P-Cores + 12 E-Cores) - Unlocked,BEWARE of the New LGA 1700 Socket,"I've been a lifetime Intel diehard fan but man they really pushed a disappointing product out. This thing gets HOT, I've been building computers for a while but I've never seen a CPU regularly spike to 100 C with liquid cooling. My previous 8700k ran great and was fulling overclocked to 4.8GHz and I never saw anything higher than 78 C under 100% load. I was so sketched out by seeing the 14700k temps that I ran Intel's CPU diagnostic software and I couldn't even finish it! The temps got to a steady 93-100 C while testing so I had to cancel it and let the CPU cool down. I even tried some gaming with it and while playing Helldivers 2 at ""High/Medium"" settings It liked to hover at 95C and spiked constantly. This caused thermal throttling and game stutters followed with it. Even while at the desktop fully idle my temps would spike around from 25 C all the way up to 70 C. The reason for this is the new LGA 1700 socket ILM, you have to buy, replace, and correctly torque a WHOLE new socket brace just so you can kind of tame this CPU. I remember when Intel was known for keeping cool and AMD for getting hot. That's not the case anymore and I'm so disappointed because Intel was my go to with every single PC I ever built.",20-Mar-24,1,Mark,the United States,negative

Intel Core i7-14700F Desktop Processor 20 cores (8 P-cores + 12 E-cores) up to 5.4 GHz,Not for me but it is a good CPU,"I ordered 14700F because I need a CPU that has similar performance compared with 14700k but consumes less power, and I was wrong about it. 1st of all, the CPU cooler come with the CPU is too weak and it limit the CPU to 65w with continuously load. The 65w power limitation severely undercut CPU performance and I get about 20,000 with Cinebench R23. A powerful cooler is definitely needed to cool down the CPU allowing it to run at 220w. With 220w on the 14700F, Cinebench R23 score has reached 33,000. For me, when 14700f paired with the original cooler, the 65w CPU is too weak for my need. In the meantime, with a powerful cooler, 14700f performs close (but not as fast) as 14700k and the 220w power consumption is not much difference compared with 14700kf's 250w PL2. Considering the price between 14700f and 14700kf, there is not much wattage difference between them. With this reason, I have decided to return it. Bottom line, For a price conscious buyer, then I think I5 is better choice because it is cheaper but performs similar compared to 14700f run at 65 watt.

IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i7-14700K New Gaming Desktop Processor 20 cores (8 P-cores + 12 E-cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked,The problem is that the CPU die is too small.,"For the effective heat transfer to be better the CPU die would have to be larger. More surface contact with pump would increase effective cooling. That is my only complaint. The concentrated heat in the processor make it hard for the cooler / pump to keep the temps down. No matter the size of the cooler the heat transfer is the bottleneck for cooling of the CPU. The processor will no matter the cooler reach 100Â°C in about 30 seconds under full load. To keep the temps down you need to throttle power limits in motherboard BIOS and lose some performance. But effectively if you do so, CPU will no longer cap at 100Â°C, but be somewhere under 80Â°C, on average 60-70Â°C. Other than that its a beast.",18-May-24,3,C4rb0n1t3,Germany,positive

Intel Core I9-14900K LGA 1700 New Gaming Desktop Processor 24 Cores (8 P-Cores + 16 E-Cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked,6.2GHZ 8200mts cl38 Daily Driver.,"This professional CPU isn't designed for the average user. However, if you're a tinkerer at heart, eager to dive deeper than the surface-level information often presented in YouTube ""videos"" (or should we say, commercials), this is unquestionably for you. I've acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailersâ€”Best Buy, Newegg, and others included. For those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fansâ€” Avoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans. Genuine static pressure fans, capable of efficiently doing the job, are what you need. Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics. When selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options. If a high-binned QVL compatible set isn't your choice, at a minimum, go for HYNIX A for single rank and HYNIX M for dual rank. The 14900K, when expertly tuned, becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouseâ€”achieving 43 to 44k in R23, with 6.2GHz boosting, 5.9GHz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads, and 16 physical e-cores at 4.7GHz for a total of 32 threads, of which only 8 are virtual. With hyper-threading and e-cores enabled, it supports 8200 to 8400 MTS CL38 DDR5 RAM, boasts sub-55ns bus latency, and sub-9.3ns FWL. It's a marvel in Aida64 full, minus SSD, burn-in stress test stability. Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns... Did I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40Â°C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50Â°C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I'd advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methodsâ€”increased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU. For tinkerers, this CPU is a dream come true. As of this dateâ€”4-4-2024: We anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve, but that's a discussion for another time. The X3D Elephant in the room: Don't worry, I own one, and this is about science, not purchase bias... We'll sidestep intricate discussions about CLDO, FCLK, and MCLK concerns, and why the substantial L3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet-based IMC in handling DDR5 for gamers. If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn't primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn't allow for it since it's not monolithic, which wouldn't be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn't fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults."" Indeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there's no cause for concern. Let's briefly touch on the ""benefits"" like reduced thermals and supposed platform longevity (as if motherboard chipset upgrades and advancements in power delivery methods don't occur... humor me, over the planned 6 years). I, too, long for Z390 features on my Z790 board (/end sarcasm), not to mention the potential for longer boot times when tinkering with DDR5 or PBO, or even under normal conditions, and texture stutter/tearing... oops, and all those other delightful topics Lisa tends to highlight without addressing the influence of influencers with communications degrees rather than computer science degrees.  Just having fun, do what you love! I don't blame Amazon, Intel, AMD, or Nvidia more than the other. Manufacturing and shipping issues happen. The chip I received from Amazon didn't meet my expectations, but my other purchases have been exceptional. By chance alone, the other four 14900Ks I've received from various distributors have been stellar! Note: Settings in pictures are daily driven....No stability concerns all AIDIA 64 Stress tested for multiple hours and hundreds of gaming/workload hours.  I can get bus latency down to under 50NS but need to decrease core clock to locked 5.8GHZ to stay at safe voltage....

Intel Core I9-14900K LGA 1700 New Gaming Desktop Processor 24 Cores (8 P-Cores + 16 E-Cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked,"until the kinks are worked out, not even a little bit worth the price.","I have had soooo many stability issues it is unreal.  I originally purchased the i9 13900k, did no overclocking but had soooo much trouble with the system that I stupidly replaced the mainboard and video card.  I didn't refund as I assumed that I had done the damage.  Literally months of troubleshooting and doubled expenses before I realized that the asus mainboard defaulted to super high wattage and the chip itself began to degrade at an extremely fast rate.  Yet again assuming that I must have done something wrong I ordered this replacement chip, to find issues suddenly occuring again.  This is about when the news dropped on mainboard suppliers and intel passing the buck on an inherently co dependant series of faults that have personally cost thousands upon thousands of dollars. I'm an IT professional, have been in the industry for more than 20 years, and have never encountered a situation so costly for the end consumer. I really hate to say it, I hold stocks in intel, I've loved them as a brand and considered them to be a number one choice, I can no longer say this. I honestly think there should be a class action lawsuit over this chip and it's predecessor I had to purchase 2  rtx 4090 and 2 asus mainboards before I could even lock down this issue.

Intel Core I9-14900K LGA 1700 New Gaming Desktop Processor 24 Cores (8 P-Cores + 16 E-Cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked,It's the perfect fit for this monster PC I just built.,"A lot of people are upset with the 14900k because of the minimal performance leap thar came between it and the 13900k. I say who cares. If you have a 13900k, don't upgrade, but if you have an older PC or 12th Gen, this is a worthy upgrade. I absolutely love mine. It's a monster of a CPU. I honestly don't recommend air cooling it. It can get pretty hot and there are only a small handful of air coolers that can handle this 14900k without setting power limits (which most people don't know how to do, let alone even know what that means) If you're not doing a custom water loop to cool your 14900k, I recommend you do what I've done to cool mine, you dont neeeed to, but it helps. I have an AIO (All-In-One Cooler) and I setup a push-pull configuration on my radiator. That means I have 3 fans on the bottom blowing in through the radiator, and 3 more fans blowing up and out of the case. Both are blowing upward. It creates more airflow. One side is pushing the air, the other side is helping pull that air through. Then I got a thermalright contact frame. Any LGA 1700 contact frame should work but the thermalright version is cheap. It might say 12th/13th Gen but it will also work on 14th Gen. So get an AIO, setup a push-pull fan configuration and get a contact frame. It's helping my Temps significantly. I typically stay in the high 50's or low 60's during 4K gaming. This CPU draws a ton of power so you might see it bump up to 80â° occasionally, for a very brief moment.

Intel Core I9-14900K LGA 1700 New Gaming Desktop Processor 24 Cores (8 P-Cores + 16 E-Cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked,IF YOU WANT THE AIR COOLED OPTION,"I'm not going to go over the same performance reviews others have done, yes its very fast for only $550 its the king of the poor mans build PC. my last PC its replacing was a $1000 10980xe and looking at the numbers the 14900k in average is 70-77% faster than the 10980xe. the only disadvantage between the 2 was the 10980xe had 48 PCIe lanes and ran 32c to 56c hot. i can't say the same about the 14900k heat, its spreader is almost half of the 10980xe. you can't just simply add a stock cooler or a ""MC'watercooler"" and expect the problem will solve itself. this is the first CPU in my 26 yrs of building PC's you have to plan out your cooler set up. ever since a 2012 water leak from these Mc'watercoolers (all in one 2 fan radiator kits sold by name brands) Ive never trusted them cost me $1500 in damages. The only water coolers that don't leak for me were the ones i built but water cooling is expensive and you have to inspect them at least every 3 months for debris in the tank or leaks. with air i only have to clean the pc 2x a year. yes you can control temps with an air cooler, and get the same temps as a 3 fan radiator water cooler. I'll post the results without adding a watt limit in the mobo post screen. here is the parts i bought to air cool running the new cinabench 2024 for 30 mins i can get max performance on a defualt non OC not hitting above 99C on the P cores 1. Noctua NH-D15 chromax.Black | Dual-Tower CPU Cooler | 140mm | Black 2. Noctua NF-A15 HS-PWM chromax.Black.swap (this adds a 3rd fan for the air cooler you'll need it) 3.

Thermalright Intel 12th/13th Generation LGA1700 Anti-Bending Buckle ( a must add a little thermal grease on the cpu side flaps this buckle is 100% aluminum will al help dissipate heat. then i went to my mother board software options (mobo is an MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX) select ""CPU cooler tuning"" select ""tower air cooling"" which will limit the wattage draw to under 300w also note if you are not using a Water Cooling Reservoir  you should also use this option, water cooling a 14900k and OC really does require a reservoir, and a 4x 120 fan size radiator if you're simply using a pre-built 2x fan radiator its not enough to handle the 14900k and the CPU is known for drawing 370w plus!! so using air cooled i got a 2371 score with no watt limiter option an temps were 78-100c on the p cores, and with the 300 watt limit the score was  2328 with temps 70-99c never hit 100c case the limiter would kick in. (note this is from CPU testing that punishes the CPU realistically i don't see this CPU going over 88c even on the most demanding game in 3 years. i personally do not recommend OC this CPU its already been pushed to its limits by INTEL at best for another 100 watts when all you're getting is 3-4 more FPS and that's not worth it. and all these people bragging a 6.2-6.5ghz OC, there just flexing for clout, then they take the CPU back to default. i already have my P cores spiking to 6.002 at 288-300 watts, and under 99c temps; adding 0.198mhz will meaning nothing for apps and gaming. personal note the MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX Gaming Motherboard is absolutely amazing at squeezing out all the performance of the 14900k worth the $700 price never crashed during testing that 26 power phases is godly  compared to my last gen EVGA x299 dark had 12 phase...RIP EGA :(",11-Feb-24,5,JZ the reviewer,the United States,negative

If you put too much voltage you are going to damage it. I want to delid it but I don't see the need and here is why Even if I can get it 20 degrees cooler it will not matter It will still need 3.5 to 4.2 volts to stay stable at advertised speeds. I am running it @ 5.4 GHZ all P cores and this thing is unbelievably reliable . And maybe 10 seconds extra to render vs 5.7 to 6.0 GHZ I get the point that ppl want to have the Bragging rights to say that it runs that fast but it will gwt damaged guaranteed 400 watts is a lot for that little unit. I think that 5.4 5.3 5.2 is more than enough specially when you have a total of 32 threads and gaming is practically single threaded . And most games are GPU bound. I only use it in the gaming department for Flight simulator and have not seen it above 68 degrees. I had a 4770 k and still running strong at 4.5 GHZ in a very small case. Intel is a beast and this I 9 is very good . Future proof for at least 5 years to come . Note. I have delided at least 20 cpus and the ones that got damaged were the ones that got a lot of voltage .

Intel Core I9-14900K LGA 1700 New Gaming Desktop Processor 24 Cores (8 P-Cores + 16 E-Cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked,Much faster than my previous i7-6850k,"So I finally upgraded my home workstation, and went to this new i9-14900K. It is incredibly fast. I had a Davinci Resolve video project file that I rendered on my old setup, the i7-6850K and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render. On the new i9, the exact same file was re exported, took just over 8 minutes..! almost a 3x speed increase.! Also, when you speed up footage in Resolve, the old cpu could not play it back smoothly, it would jump and chug like crazy, the new i9, it plays it back sped up 800% no problems and I can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly. Applications open u p much faster too, but that could be more due to the pcie4.0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme I had in the old build. The one thing I do not like about the new cpu, is the number of pci lanes. You only get 20, 16 are pcie5.0 and 4 are pcie4.0. This wont be an issue for most people, but my old cpu had 40 lanes, allowing me to run 3 GPU's at the same time, and YES, I needed them, I use GPU rendering software that can use up to 8 GPU's in one system on one license and every additional GPU speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3D sims. With this new cpu, I can only run 2 GPU's and they run at 8x, cause they share the 16x, and that does leave me 4 full pcie4.0 lanes for the system drive. It is not a deal breaker, and the increased speed overall is well worth it. One thing EVERYBODY should be aware of, is these new intel chips have P cores and E cores. Something my old cpu did NOT have. E-cores can severely impact certain software performance. When I booted up the new machine and tried my Ableton DAW  for the first time, I was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost, and the software was literally almost unusable.! The E-cores were slowing the software down so bad, I could barely change settings in the preferences.! It was that bad. I had to install process lasso ( fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it ) and disable the use of E-cores for Ableton and then it worked very fast and is great.!",19-Mar-24,5,Eric E.,the United States,positive

It's OK but I can't rave over it.  It is more of an sideways change rather than an upgrade. The i9-14900K is fast but not more so that a i9-13900K.  For me, the Cinebench R23 scores are about the same for 13th versus 14th gen.  Though the i9-14900K appears to run DDR5 more stably and at higher frequencies than the i9-13900K.  Also, the i9-14900K is enabled for XTU AI enable tuning in XTU but it's not that helpful.  I even wonder if it is worth getting a K at all, these CPU's are plenty fast for gaming without overclocking. I did NOT notice a significant improvement in the operating temperatures.  Maybe a slight improvement but I did flush out the cooling system and clean out the water block so I am doubtful that the running temps are better.  Also, I suggest that you NOT let these chips get anywhere near TjMax (100C).  I had one i9-13900KF literally fail due to allowing it to get to TjMax frequently when stress testing.  A second one became slightly flaky. I thought the built in ARC display support of the K version might be helpful since I intended to devote the graphics card to the gaming monitor and use the built-in ARC on a side display.  But as it turns out, it wasn't worth it for me.  If you are gaming with this level of processor, you really need a comparable graphics card but most of them will drive four displays.  IMO, you are better off getting a KF and spending the money so saved on better graphics card. The original asking price was insane, I bought it on a whim on a late night.

I was going to buy another 13900k or maybe the ks version, but I decided to wait for the 14900k. The 14900k I got on the other hand has some overclocking headroom. I already set all P-cores to 5.8GHz, while keeping the double-core Turbo Boost at 6.0GHz. I also set the cache to 5.2Ghz and it's completely stable. I was not able to raise the multiplier at all with my 13900k. Just happy my 14900k isn't a lottery loser. While the clock of both the 13900ks and 14900k are the same, the 13900ks has a cherry picked memory controller. If you're looking to do a ton of RAM overclocking then the 13900ks may be the way to go.... but that's not to say if you'd get a 14900k with a good memory controller. Both my 13900k and 14900k work with DDR5-7200 RAM with XMP set, and no adjustments to the memory controller voltages. If you're buying the 14900k off the get-go and building a new system around it, then I recommend pairing it with a motherboard that has the BIOS Flashback feature.",22-Oct-23,5,Another Customer,the United States,positive

Coming from an i7-8700k, the performance boost is nothing short of incredible. Multitasking, gaming, and content creation have all seen a significant improvement. Multithreaded applications and gaming experiences run smoother.  It's a productivity powerhouse. The clock speeds are no slouch either, making it excellent for single-threaded tasks and gaming. The major downside of this CPU is the heat it generates. Even with a high-end cooling solution, it tends to run hot, and that's something you must take into consideration when setting up your cooling solution. Be ready for this CPU to draw a significant amount of power at full load. It can put quite a load on your power supply and might necessitate an upgrade if you're not already prepared.

The mystery of not knowing how much stress was put into the processor before sending it is complicated, when a new product was expected. Update: The processor was indeed damaged, the first problem was that it prevented the installation of Windows. The way to verify the fault was by entering the BIOS and deactivating all the cores, then I activated them one by one. With only one core it allowed Windows to be installed, the summary was: all the E-cores worked, of the P-Cores 4, 6 and 7 were damaged since when turning on any of those three from the BIOS, it generated blue screens, froze or closed programs randomly.

Intel Core I9-14900Kf LGA 1700 New Gaming Desktop Processor 24 Cores (8 P-Cores + 16 E-Cores) - Unlocked,Die pure Kraft - IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i9-14900KF,"After upgrading my PC with the Intel Core i9-14900KF, I can say that this processor is a real powerhouse. Here are my impressions after extensive use: Performance: With its 24 cores and an impressive clock speed, the i9-14900KF delivers incredible performance. Whether it's gaming, video editing, or multitasking, this processor handles it all with ease. In games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Red Dead Redemption 2, the graphics run buttery smooth, even at the highest settings. Loading times are minimal, and gameplay is absolutely fluid. Multitasking: I often work with several demanding applications at once - from Adobe Premiere Pro to Photoshop to Blender. The i9-14900KF handles these tasks without breaking a sweat. Even when I'm rendering a video and working on a large photo editing project in another window at the same time, the system remains responsive and stable. Cooling: Speaking of cooling, the i9-14900KF can get quite warm under load. I opted for a high-quality water cooling system from NZXT (Kraken 360 Elite) to keep the temperatures under control. With this AIO, the processor stays cool and quiet even during intensive gaming sessions or long rendering times. Value for money: The price of the i9-14900KF is certainly not low, but given the performance offered, I think it is justified. For enthusiasts and professionals who need maximum performance, this processor is a worthwhile investment. Conclusion: The Intel Core i9-14900KF is an absolute monster in terms of performance. Whether gaming, creative work or multitasking, this processor delivers consistently impressive results. The ability to overclock offers additional scope for performance enthusiasts. Even though it is a bit more expensive and requires good cooling, I am completely happy with my choice and can recommend the i9-14900KF to anyone who wants to get the most out of their system.",11-Jun-24,5,Uwe,Germany,positive
Intel Core I9-14900Kf LGA 1700 New Gaming Desktop Processor 24 Cores (8 P-Cores + 16 E-Cores) - Unlocked,Running air cooled on DeepCool Assassin IV with ease,"So far so good.  This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS. In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games **Update** I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power. If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on. The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.  Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.  My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC. Core wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen.",03-Nov-23,5,Amazon lover,the United States,positive

Intel Core I9-14900Kf LGA 1700 New Gaming Desktop Processor 24 Cores (8 P-Cores + 16 E-Cores) - Unlocked,"Fast, but unstable when overclocked.","I built 3 systems using 14900 series. They all had serious stability problems when in use.  After researching for weeks and reinstalling OS with no better result.  I finally disabled overclocking ""AI overclocking"", which was running as high as 1.6v.  I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE.  this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully.  It basically throttles the chip. I can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out.  Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all ""tests"" showed it was fine.  I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive.  It does run HOT even with water cooling.  IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5.  Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips. Here's the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use.  Adobe CS uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync iGPU simultaneously which rarely went above 40%, and usually was around 15-20 when editing.  HW encodes for HD were at 350fps, software, 250, intel 300.  So a small advantage in Adobe CS is why I went with the 14900K vs KF. System was using ""AI overclocking"" pushing it to 6.2 roughly single core.  Disabled in BIOS now. Specs: Asus z290a Wifi II, Corsair 96GB DDR5 5600, Samsung 990 Pro, CPU Water cooled, 3080ti So the ""K"" is basically useless for me at this point and don't see myself doing it manually as it's just not worth it to me.

IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i9-14900KS Desktop Processor 24 cores (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores),Disappointing Performance-to-Price Ratio.,"The IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i9-14900KS Desktop Processor arrives with much anticipation, boasting impressive specifications on paper. However, a closer examination reveals that this processor falls short of delivering the expected value for its price tag. At first glance, the i9-14900KS appears promising, with its high clock speeds and purported performance enhancements. However, when put to the test, it becomes evident that the marginal improvements over its predecessors do not justify the hefty price premium attached to it. One of the major drawbacks of the i9-14900KS is its lackluster performance gains in real-world scenarios. Despite the incremental upgrades in clock speeds and architecture, users may find that the difference in performance compared to previous generations is negligible in most tasks, from gaming to content creation. Moreover, the i9-14900KS faces stiff competition from rival processors, such as those from AMD's Ryzen lineup, which offer comparable performance at a more reasonable price point. In terms of value for money, the i9-14900KS simply does not measure up, as consumers can find better alternatives that provide similar or even superior performance without breaking the bank. Furthermore, the i9-14900KS's power consumption and thermal management remain areas of concern. Despite being marketed as a high-performance processor, it tends to run hot under heavy workloads, requiring robust cooling solutions to prevent thermal throttling and maintain stable operation. In conclusion, while the IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i9-14900KS Desktop Processor may appeal to enthusiasts seeking the latest and greatest hardware, its lack of significant performance improvements and unfavorable price-to-performance ratio makes it a hard sell for the average consumer. With more cost-effective options available on the market, investing in the i9-14900KS may not be the wisest decision for those looking to maximize their computing power without breaking the bank.",30-Mar-24,5,DUBNASTY,the United States,future expectation

After only 1 month of overall decent stability, I'm just now starting to get random CRC failures when extracting archives, blue screens, game crashes; even despite having run on Intel's new power profiles since the start (from post-May-deadline set by Intel on Motherboard manufacturers) designed to avoid damaging the CPUs while Intel explores their RMA nightmare; and this CPU still managed to experience serious degradation not unlike other high end i9s in the Raptor Lake Refresh. I've already upgraded from a 14900K to a 14900KS (14900K lasted 6 months before RMA too), but this 14900KS here only lasted less than 30 days before 14th gen CPU-gate issues struck again, and it is absolutely eating this new 14900KS alive. Edit: As of this writing (June 15 2014), there is a microcode update that Intel will be pushing to BIOS vendors to fix a bug in CPU causing the CPU's Extended Adaptive Thermal Boost parameters to be set too high, which apparently is a contributing factor.  I don't believe it will necessarily fix the sudden physical depredation that my CPU has already undergone, however, I would advise anyone interested to steer clear of 14th Gen i9's until Intel has root-caused the hardware issues to prevent anyone getting stuck in a ""try-break-RMA-repeat"" support loop until this is all more understood.

Within about 15 minutes, I could no longer even open games that used UE5. Constant crashing in other CPU heavy tasks. I spent 8 hours troubleshooting my PC and doing research into the issue to come to the conclusion that everyone else having these symptoms also had i9-13900/14900 KS CPUs.

I was able to achieve 5.9 Ghz by default stock clockspeed with my air cooler Noctua NH-D15. Yes, I had to adjust System Voltage via BIOS to ensure system stability, otherwise the game will crash which I recommend to set it between 1.11 V - 1.15V, otherwise leaving it by default may push SA voltage to around 2.10 - 3.00 V which is very dangerous to your memory controller. Yes, IMC (Integrated Memory Controller) does matter when it comes to RAM overclocking, however, not all RAM and CPU can achieve same clockspeed and volage due to silicon lottery. Other than that, I'm happy with the results, able to run much higher framerate, no frame drop during livestreaming via OBS and works perfectly fine with ASUS Apex Encore Z790 Motherboard. P.S.  You may have to turn on Intel SVID default behavior to ensure system stability which you may have to download & flash the latest UEFI BIOS, regardless your motherboard vendor such as ASUS, MSI, GIGABYTE, EVGA, Biostar, etc. All in all, I recommend this product if you have sufficient cooling but also want to achieve much higher clock speed via better binning.

The Amazon experience was very negative, especially on the Amazon warehouse side, initially the product was purchased with this formula, but I had to return it (reordered then new), because the processor had been tampered with (visual evidence, but only if seen very enlarged ) somehow, the problem is that Amazon does not check the functionality of the returned products, and puts them back on the market, an unfair practice I must say, I am currently still waiting for the refund (1 week of waiting at the moment), and I had to pay the cost in advance of the new.

IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i9-14900K New Gaming Desktop Processor 24 cores (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked,Cons: Practically a 13900K with higher temperatures. Pros: Excellent single core power,"The product itself does not need a review, in terms of technology nothing has changed from the previous generation, it only has an extra 0.2MHz in Turbo Boost but at a high cost in efficiency. Sometimes with certain intensive loads it exceeds 300W (only the CPU, not counting the rest of the system). It's simply a 13900k but slightly overclocked from the factory. Unlike its counterpart, it has significantly lower efficiency. We recommend purchasing only if you have a powerful power supply, a high-performance heatsink (possibly 360mm AIO) and the willingness to see your electricity bill increase. In terms of performance it is comparable to its AMD counterpart but has more brute force in environments where single core is in high demand. In general: if you only want to dedicate yourself to gaming, get a Ryzen 7 7800X3D which is the best choice, if you only dedicate yourself to multithreading and rendering loads, the 7950X is excellent. However, if you do both without worrying about compromises, the 13900k/14900k is a choice worth considering. Bearing in mind consumption, temperatures and the fact that the next Intel socket will not be LGA1700 (therefore there will be no possibility of future upgrades) instead AMD will continue with socket AM5 for a few more years. Purchased first from Amazon Warehouse and arrived in poor condition with oxidized pads and a deep mark on the surface. Sent back because it didn't work. I decided to send the second one back too due to obvious consumption problems. As always, Amazon's service is impeccable.
